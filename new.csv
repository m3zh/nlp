Teachers are positioned to support students’ development of emotion regulation in the social context of school. We sought to determine K-12 teachers’ sense of responsibility, preparation, engagement, comfort, and approach to teaching students emotion regulation. The quantitative and qualitative data we gathered from 155 general K-12 classroom teachers revealed a sense of responsibility, low preparation, varied engagement, and low to moderate comfort. We found differences by grade levels, school location, and teacher education level. There was moderate alignment between how the teachers regulate their emotions and the emotion regulation processes they teach their students. We share implications for school psychologists and suggest multiple directions for future research.</jats:p>",crossref,

The causative agent of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 is the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The review presents modern data on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and course of the novel coronavirus infection COVID-19 in children. Chinese, American and European scientists have described a variety of cutaneous manifestations in children with COVID-19. The article provides a literature review of the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 coronavirus infection in children. During our own observation of 301 patients with coronavirus infection COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 at the Bashlyaevs Children Hospital in Moscow from May 17 to November 16, 2020, it was revealed that 39 (13 %) patients had skin manifestations.

Objective: to study the comparative dynamic epidemiological and immunological characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Materials and methods. Methodological approaches to the use of system analysis of epidemiological and immunological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 using multivariate analysis are described. The used technologies of computer-aided analysis systems, algorithms for recognizing, measuring and identifying the condition of patients, and methods of statistical data processing made it possible to create a universal information predictive model for calculating the dynamics of infectious diseases prone to generalization (pandemics), as well as to understand in which groups these new infectious diseases are most dangerous. Results and discussion. Using the methods of system analysis, the epidemiological and immunological aspects of predictive models of the coronavirus pandemic were evaluated using the most objective international data, which increased the information content of the analysis. Conclusions . Creating predictive epidemiological and immunological models of the pandemic is an urgent and promising task to combat the medical and social consequences of the spread of coronavirus infection in Russia.</jats:p>",crossref,

The brains were collected from six male adult bats of each species: Noctilio leporinus (fish-eating), Phyllostomus hastatus (carnivorous/ omnivorous) and Carollia perspicillata (fruit-eating) and were double-embedded and transverse serial sections were cut and stained with cresyl fast violet. The results showed that the MNTB is well developed in all the bats in general and the mean length of the MNTB was 1160 ± 124 µm in N. leporinus, 400 ± 59 µm in P. hastatus and 320 ± 25µm in C. perspicillata. The body and brain weight do not reflect proportionately on the size of the MNTB in the present study. The hearing frequency spectrum did not covary with the size of the MNTB among the bats studied. The MNTB is clearly demarcated from the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB) only in P. hastatus. The MNTB comprised mainly three types of cells in all three bats: dense-staining multipolar cells (12.5 µm and 25.0 µm diameter); light-staining multipolar cells measuring (12.5 µm and 25.0 µm diameter) and light-staining round cells (5.0 µm diameter). The large sized MNTB was observed in N. leporinus, which suggests that it relies heavily on echolocation whereas P. hastatus and C. perspicillata use echolocation as well but also rely on hearing, smell and vision.</jats:p>",crossref,

For this, an Oxisol was submitted to different doses of sheep manure and was subsequently evaluated for Folsomia candida survival and avoidance behavior through standardized ecotoxicological assays, the initial performance of oats by germination test and the soil basal respiration rate by respirometry methodology. There was an increase in the basal respiration rate of the soil by the application of sheep manure and this was consistent with the increase of the doses. The survival rate and avoidance behavior of springtails were not altered and there was no change in the initial performance of oats, indicating that this manure can be used for organic fertilization of soils with low soil pollutant potential.</jats:p>",crossref,

According to the World Health Organization, pneumonia kills about 2 million children under the age of 5 and is constantly estimated to be the leading cause of infant mortality, killing more children than AIDS, malaria, and measles combined. A key element in the diagnosis is radiographic data, as chest x-rays are routinely obtained as a standard of care and can aid to differentiate the types of pneumonia. However, a rapid radiological interpretation of images is not always available, particularly in places with few resources, where childhood pneumonia has the highest incidence and mortality rates. As an alternative, the application of deep learning techniques for the classification of medical images has grown considerably in recent years. This study presents five implementations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs): ResNet50, VGG-16, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNeXt50. To support the diagnosis of the disease, these CNNs were applied to solve the classification problem of medical radiographs from people with pneumonia. InceptionResNetV2 obtained the best recall and precision results for the Normal and Pneumonia classes, 93.95% and 97.52% respectively. ResNeXt50 achieved the best precision and f1-score results for the Normal class (94.62% and 94.25% respectively) and the recall and f1-score results for the Pneumonia class (97.80% and 97.65%, respectively).</jats:p>",crossref,

For this purpose, sample data is collected from the annual reports of top ten banks of USA from 2001 to 2017. A panel unit root is applied to check the stationarity of variables. In order to explain the impact of bank capital, capital structure and monetary policy on lending behavior of USA banks, fixed effect and random effect model have been used. The sample data has been divided into two sets. First data set is taken from 2001 to 2008 before financial crises. Second data set is taken from 2009 to 2017 after financial crises and all above tests have been applied on these data sets. Furthermore, in order to measure the lending behavior three types of lending have been selected lending to consumers, lending to real estate and lending to commercial &amp; industrial sector of USA banks. In order to get the better picture of lending behavior of USA banks before and after financial crises: paired sample T-test has been applied on the data of lending before and after financial crises. Results of paired sample T-test showed there is significant difference in lending to consumers, lending to commercial &amp; industrial sector and lending to real estate before and after financial crises of USA banks because of the implementation of Basel III. So, we accept the alternative hypothesis for our second research question. Findings suggested that impact of bank capital, capital structure and monetary policy has significant impact on the lending behavior before and after the global financial crises with the positive change of sixteen percent in R-squared value. So, we accept the alternative hypothesis for our first research question. The results of coefficients shows that before financial crises (2001 to 2008) discounted interest rates have more significant impact on the lending made to consumers but after the global financial crises (2009 to 2017) discounted interest rates, capital structure and tier 1 capital ratio have more significant impact on the loan made to consumers. The results of coefficients shows that before the financial crises (2001 to 2008) discounted interest rates have more significant impact on the loan made to commercial and industrial sector but after the global financial crises (2009 to 2017) discounted interest rates, capital structure and tier 1 capital ratio have more significant impact on the loan made to commercial and industrial sector. The results of coefficients shows that before financial crises (2001 to 2008) discounted interest rates have more significant impact on the loan made to real estate but after the global financial crises (2009 to 2017) discounted interest rates and capital structure have more significant impact on the loan made to real estate. Findings of our study are aligned with Swamy (2015), who investigated the impact of bank capital on lending spreads and found that increase in capital ratio of banks would also increase their lending spreads. Our results are also matched with the findings of (Kosak et al., 2015), those concluded that capital structure significantly affect the loan growth of banks. Our results are also aligned with Chami &amp; Cosimano (2010), they found that change in monetary policy due to Basel Accord would lead to a change in bank capital and bank loans.</jats:p>",crossref,
231,Enhancing three variants of harmony search algorithm for continuous optimization problems,,,,10.11591/ijece.v11i3.pp2343-2349,"{'given': 'Alaa A.', 'family': 'Alomoush', 'sequence': 'first', 'affiliation': []}","<jats:p>Meta-heuristic algorithms are well-known optimization methods, for solving real-world optimization problems. Harmony search (HS) is a recognized meta-heuristic algorithm with an efficient exploration process. But the HS has a slow convergence rate, which causes the algorithm to have a weak exploitation process in finding the global optima. Different variants of HS introduced in the literature to enhance the algorithm and fix its problems, but in most cases, the algorithm still has a slow convergence rate. Meanwhile, opposition-based learning (OBL), is an effective technique used to improve the performance of different optimization algorithms, including HS. In this work, we adopted a new improved version of OBL, to improve three variants of Harmony Search, by increasing the convergence rate speed of these variants and improving overall performance. The new OBL version named improved opposition-based learning (IOBL), and it is different from the original OBL by adopting randomness to increase the solution's diversity. To evaluate the hybrid algorithms, we run it on benchmark functions to compare the obtained results with its original versions. The obtained results show that the new hybrid algorithms more efficient compared to the original versions of HS. A convergence rate graph is also used to show the overall performance of the new algorithms.</jats:p>",crossref,

D.', 'family': 'Elsawy', 'sequence': 'first', 'affiliation': []}","<jats:p>The dunes sand is wide spread with huge quantities all over the world especially in desert areas near roads. The objective of the current paper is to use dunes sand as a foundation soil under structures instead of utilizing expensive replacement with structural fills. The dunes sand samples were collected from a site outside Tabuk city in the north-west of Saudi Arabia. Several experimental tests were performed on the dunes sand samples such as sieve analysis, standard Proctor compaction, drained direct shear and CBR. The test results indicated that the sand dunes are SP according to USCS. The sand dunes have also low shear strength and CBR value. The bearing ability of the sand dunes became weaker due to water immersion. Therefore, the construction on the non-treated dunes sand is impossible. For the later reason, the dunes sand was stabilized with various ordinary Portland cement fractions ranging from 3% to 15%. Compaction and CBR tests were conducted on the stabilized dunes sand. The maximum dry density increased as the increments of the cement contents accompanying with the decrement of porosity and optimum moisture content. The stabilized dunes sand implied higher CBR values than the non-treated soil.  The CBR values of the stabilized soil increased with increasing cement fractions. The stabilized dunes sand induced very high CBR values after longer curing times for all the utilized cement contents. The stabilized dunes sand using only 3% is considered the optimum design achieving good performance under structures and best economic mix.</jats:p>",crossref,

WLP technology uses various interconnection structures including microbumps and through-silicon-vias (TSVs). To increase yield and reduce cost, there is an increasing
 demand for wafer level testing. Contact behavior between probe and interconnection structure is a very important factor affecting the reliability and performance of wafer testing. In this study, with a MEMS vertical probe, we performed systematic numerical analysis of the deformation behavior
 of various interconnection structures, including solder bump, copper (Cu) pillar bump, solder capper Cu bump, and TSV. During probing, the solder ball showed the largest deformation. The Cu pillar bump also exhibited relatively large deformation. The Cu bump began to deform at OD of 10 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>m.
 At OD of 20 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>m, bump pillar was compressed, and the height of the bump decreased by 8.3%. The deformation behavior of the solder capped Cu bump was similar to that of the solder ball. At OD of 20 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>m, the solder and Cu bumps were largely deformed, and the total height was
 reduced by 11%. The TSV structure showed the lowest deformation, but exerted the largest stress on the probe. In particular, copper protrusion at the outer edge of the via was observed, and very large shear stress was generated between the via and the silicon oxide layer. In summary, when
 probing various interconnection structures, the probe stress is less than that when using an aluminum pad. On the other hand, deformation of the structure is a critical issue. In order to minimize damage to the interconnection structure, smaller size probes or less overdrive should be used.
 This study will provide important guidelines for performing wafer-level testing and minimizing damage of probes and interconnection structures.</jats:p>",crossref,

There is great concern about the impact of these plants on non-target organisms. On the other hand, there is little information in the literature on the effects of transgenics (Bacillus thuringiensis) Bt on populations of phytophagous mites, and the physiological responses that this attack promotes on plants. The objective of this work was to evaluate the biology of the T. ludeni mite in Bt cotton, expressing the Cry1F and Cry1Ac proteins. To evaluate the behavior of food and oviposition preference of the T. ludeni with Bt cotton and isohybrid. Verify if the physiological stress caused by T. ludeni’s attack is differentiated in Bt cotton. The mites were reared in Bt cotton and isohybrid, in a total of 40 replicates in the completely randomized design and the biological cycle was evaluated. The food preference and oviposition analysis were done with 10 replicates, with choice. The physiological stress was evaluated through chlorophyll fluorescence, under greenhouse conditions. The data of the T. ludeni biology were analyzed by Student's t-test, for food and oviposition preference the chi-square test was performed. Regression models were fitted for the fluorescence parameters. The model identity test was used to evaluate the differences between Bt and isohybrid treatments. Cry1F and Cry1Ac proteins have not affected the biology of T. ludeni. The photosynthetic parameters in Bt cotton plants were less influenced by T. ludeni infestation.</jats:p>",crossref,

1000,[Children with high potential and difficulties: Contributions of clinical research].,2018-10-16,,L'Encephale,S0013-7006(18)30164-7,,"We have been sensitized to children with high intellectual potential (HIP) having difficulties given the number of children consulting in our outpatient medico-psychological centres for scholastic problems (possibly leading to school failure), anxiety disorders or behavioral disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and in which a high intellectual potential was discovered during psychological assessments. It is the contrast, and more precisely the paradox, between the high intellectual potential of these children and their scholastic difficulties (including school failure), and the psychic suffering expressed by some of them, which led us to question, challenge and propose therapeutic and educational care adapted to these children. It is in this context that we created in December 2005 the CNAHP (National Center for Assistance to High Potential children and adolescents) which is a public centre integrated into the hospital-university department of child and adolescent psychiatry at Rennes. It is noteworthy that not all children with HIP have difficulties, and children with school failure or behavioral problems are not always children with HIP. However, it is necessary not to minimize the problem raised by children with HIP with difficulties by ignoring its frequency or by considering that these children are ""intelligent"" enough to manage by themselves and do not need to be helped, whereas some of them can show school failure and even be de-scholarized. Indeed, based on the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO) of an intellectual Quotient (IQ) above 130 (level corresponding to a statistical threshold), the frequency of children with HIP represents 2.3% of the population of schoolchildren aged 6 to 16. The frequency is therefore not so rare. However, it remains to be determined by French epidemiological studies what is the actual frequency of children with difficulties within a population of children with HIP. The analysis of the CNAHP research data from a clinical population (children with HIP consulting for difficulties) highlights that children with HIP can show major school problems (including school failure, defined here as having or foreseeing repetition of a grade), which corresponds to 7.5% of 611 children with HIP consulting at the CNAHP) and socioemotional problems (emotional regulation disorders) in relation to their high intellectual potential. In particular, anxiety disorders were the most frequent psychiatric disorders observed in this population (40.5%) and were significantly associated with high verbal potential. This significant association requires further studies to avoid establishing a simplistic unidirectional and reductive linear cause-effect relationships. Indeed, a high verbal potential can elicit and/or reinforce anxiety-producing representations, but anxiety disorders may also lead to a defensive over investment of verbal language. The results are discussed in this article and suggest that scholastic and/or psychological difficulties encountered by some children with HIP can be related to their high intellectual potential. It is necessary to develop therapeutic and educational care adapted to these children from a better understanding, based on research results, of their possible difficulties but also cognitive abilities. Even when children with HIP have scholastic and/or psychological difficulties, some of their cognitive skills can be preserved contrary to appearances, with for example, as seen in the CNAHP results, excellent attentional capacities shown by cognitive tests contrasting with behavioral attention deficit reported by parents. These skills are important to identify as they are resources which support the therapeutic and educational project. It is probably through an articulation among professionals from national education, health and research, in alliance with the family (parents, child, and siblings), that advances will be made. In the same way that professionals have been interested in children with intellectual disabilities, it is important to be concerned by children with HIP and difficulties located at the other end of the continuum. It is a question of ethics which concerns both caregivers and teachers. It is also a societal issue that concerns all of us given that the expression of high intellectual and creative potential in children may be essential to the societal development of innovative strategies and each nation's future. Finally, the discussion can be extended to all children, independent of their potential. What we learn from children with HIP and difficulties can be applied to each child: it is important at family, school and societal levels to facilitate the expression of the potential of children, to value their skills, and to help them to remove possible inhibitions of their potential based on individualized projects. The acceptance of singularity and differences in children can contribute to tolerance and the development of creativity, in the interest of the subject and of society.",pubmed,

1002,Behavioral profiles of clinically referred children with intellectual giftedness.,2013-07-10,,BioMed research international,10.1155/2013/540153,,"It is common that intellectually gifted children--that is, children with an IQ ≥ 130--are referred to paediatric or child neuropsychiatry clinics for socio-emotional problems and/or school underachievement or maladjustment. These clinically-referred children with intellectual giftedness are thought to typically display internalizing problems (i.e., self-focused problems reflecting overcontrol of emotion and behavior), and to be more behaviorally impaired when ""highly"" gifted (IQ ≥ 145) or displaying developmental asynchrony (i.e., a heterogeneous developmental pattern, reflected in a significant verbal-performance discrepancy on IQ tests). We tested all these assumptions in 143 clinically-referred gifted children aged 8 to 12, using Wechsler's intelligence profile and the Child Behavior Checklist. Compared to a normative sample, gifted children displayed increased behavioral problems in the whole symptomatic range. Internalizing problems did not predominate over externalizing ones (i.e., acted-out problems, reflecting undercontrol of emotion and behavior), revealing a symptomatic nature of behavioral syndromes more severe than expected. ""Highly gifted"" children did not display more behavioral problems than the ""low gifted."" Gifted children with a significant verbal-performance discrepancy displayed more externalizing problems and mixed behavioral syndromes than gifted children without such a discrepancy. These results suggest that developmental asynchrony matters when examining emotional and behavioral problems in gifted children.",pubmed,
1003,Teachers' implicit personality theories about the gifted: an experimental approach.,2013-01-28,,"School psychology quarterly : the official journal of the Division of School Psychology, American Psychological Association",10.1037/spq0000011,,"The implicit theories teachers hold about the gifted influence their perception of and behavior toward highly able students, thus impacting the latter's educational opportunities. Two persistent stereotypes about the gifted can be distinguished: the harmony hypothesis (gifted students are superior in almost all domains) and the disharmony hypothesis (giftedness implies maladaptive social behavior and emotional problems). The present study investigated whether teachers' implicit personality theories about the gifted are in line with the harmony or the disharmony hypothesis. Using an experimental vignette approach, we examined 321 prospective and practicing teachers' implicit personality theories (based on the big five personality framework) about students described along three dimensions (ability level, gender, and age, resulting in 8 different vignettes), controlling for teachers' age, gender, experience with gifted students, and knowledge about giftedness. Ability level had the strongest effect on teachers' ratings (partial η² = .60). Students described as gifted were perceived as more open to new experiences, more introverted, less emotionally stable, and less agreeable (all ps < .001). No differences were found for conscientiousness. Gender and its interaction with ability level had a small effect (partial η²s = .04 and .03). Thus, teachers' implicit personality theories about the gifted were in line with the disharmony hypothesis. Possible consequences for gifted identification and education are discussed.",pubmed,

Self-esteem may be an indicator of social-emotional adjustment but insufficient in its explanatory capacity, especially high self-esteem which tends to produce opposite responses in regards to adjustment. A distinction between defensive and genuine high self-esteem could account for these results. In order to understand how self-esteem operates on social-emotional adjustment, it should be associated with other measurements relating to self-concern. In the Rorschach comprehensive system (CS), egocentricity index measures self-centeredness, which can be defined as the balance between self-concern and concern for others. High self-concern is associated with a neglect of the others. Operationalized here, as the interaction of high self-esteem and excessive self-concern, defensive high self-esteem should predict maladaptive outcomes.",pubmed,

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a tailored behavioural parenting intervention, for enhancing the parenting skills of parents of gifted children and to assess the effect of these changes on the behavioural and emotional adjustment of their gifted child. A randomised controlled trial of tailored Group Triple P - Positive Parenting Program was conducted with 75 parents of children identified as gifted. Results indicated significant intervention effects for the number and frequency of parent reported child behaviour problems, as well as hyperactivity in the intervention group, relative to a waitlist control. Parents also reported significant improvements in their own parenting style, including less permissiveness, harshness, and verbosity when disciplining their child. No intervention effects were evident for teacher reports, except for a trend in relation to hyperactivity. This study demonstrated that a tailored behavioural parenting intervention is effective and acceptable for parents of gifted children, and thus has clinical implications for the delivery of parenting interventions for this population.",pubmed,
