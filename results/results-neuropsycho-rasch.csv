2363,2596,Using Rasch measurement theory to assess three depression scales among adults with epilepsy.,2012-05-18 00:00:00,,Seizure,10.1016/j.seizure.2012.04.009,Elizabeth Reisinger Walker,"People with chronic conditions, such as epilepsy, are at a high risk for depression; however depression is often under-recognized and undertreated. Depression scales, including one specific to people with epilepsy, have been used for screening in this population, although none have been assessed with Rasch measurement theory. This study used Rasch analyses in order to evaluate and compare the psychometric properties of the modified Beck Depression Inventory, the Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy in a sample of people with epilepsy and depression who participated in an intervention designed to reduce depressive symptoms. A secondary purpose was to assess item functioning across time. The sample includes 44 participants in the Project UPLIFT program who completed the assessments before and after taking part in the intervention. Results of the Rasch analysis indicate that the three depression scales functioned as intended. There was good overall targeting between the items and the sample, acceptable model-data fit, and good reliability of separation for persons, items, and time. The participants experienced a significant decrease in depressive symptoms from pretest to posttest. This study illustrates the value of using model-based measurement with the Rasch model to combine items across the three depression scales. It also demonstrates an approach for analyzing and evaluating the results of small scale intervention programs, such as the UPLIFT program.",pubmed,0.9999999999999999

The Adults and Older Adults Functional Assessment Inventory is a new measure of basic and instrumental activities of daily living. Rasch model analyses were used to analyze the psychometric characteristics of the instrument in a sample of 803 participants. The original categories did not provide an optimal assessment of functional incapacity. The scale was dichotomized to achieve a better reliability score and item fit. The final 50 items revealed a moderately high variability in item difficulty, acceptable fits to items and persons, and a good Person Separation Reliability score. The scores were able to discriminate between normal controls and clinical patients. None of the items showed Differential Item Functioning associated with age, gender, or education. The instrument is able to achieve measures of functional incapacity with the useful properties of the Rasch model. ",pubmed,0.9748374327139853

A sample of 1,108 students with and without a diagnosis of learning disabilities took part in study 1. Using information from modern theory methods (i.e., the Rasch model), a scale was created that included fewer than one third of the original battery items designed to assess reading skills. This best item synthesis was then evaluated for its predictive and criterion validity with a valid external reading battery (study 2). Using a sample of 232 students with and without learning disabilities, results indicated that the brief version of the scale was equally effective as the original scale in predicting reading achievement. Analysis of the content of the brief scale indicated that the best item synthesis involved items from cognition, motivation, strategy use, and advanced reading skills. It is suggested that multiple psychometric criteria be employed in evaluating the psychometric adequacy of scales used for the assessment and identification of learning disabilities and comorbid disorders.",pubmed,0.9020413358458221

The total sample comprised of 897 participants distributed between two main subgroups: (I) healthy group that was comprised of 650 cognitively healthy community dwellers and (II) clinical group that was comprised of 90 patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment, 90 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 33 patients with frontotemporal dementia, and 34 patients with vascular dementia recruited at a reference dementia clinic. All patients were investigated through a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, laboratory tests essential to exclude a reversible form of dementia, imaging studies (CT or MRI and SPECT or FDG-PET), Apolipoprotein E allele genotyping and CSF biomarker (Aβ42,Tau, and P-tau) analyses. The clinical diagnosis was established through the consensus of a multidisciplinary team, based on international criteria. The results demonstrated an overall good fit of both items and the person's values, a high variability on cognitive performance level, and a good quality of the measurements. The MoCA scores also demonstrated adequate discriminant validity, with high diagnostic value. DIF analyses indicated the generalized validity of the MoCA scores. In conclusion, the results of this study show the overall psychometric adequacy of the MoCA and verify the discriminant and generalized validity of the obtained results. ",pubmed,0.8459413911141401
4160,4565,Outcome measures of antidepressive therapy.,,,Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica. Supplementum,,R Rosenberg,"A variety of outcome measures assessing antidepressive therapy are available. However, in randomized clinical trials, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) is often the primary outcome measure. Results from factor analysis and Rasch item analysis indicate that the HAM-D is heterogeneous and that the sum of items scores may not be an adequate measure of the severity of depression. A Melancholia Scale of 11 items has been suggested as a more valid measure of the core symptoms of affective syndrome. Other global outcome measures, focusing on health-related quality of life issues and on social functioning as well as macro-economic analyses are also used in depression. Applying stringent and well-documented outcome measures in randomized clinical trials of antidepressants may give the clinician a better indication of the most appropriate drug for treatment of the individual patient.",pubmed,0.8415548552853562

Evaluation of objectivity using logistic models.,,,Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,,P Bech,"The consistency of the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) as a measure of the severity of depressive states has been examined when the scale was used weekly during a trial when imipramine. By use of logistic models (Rasch) the consistency of the HDS has been considered across patient-variables as age, sex, plasma levels of imipramine, and diagnosis. The results showed that the original 17-item HDS was without adequate consistency, i.e. the total score of the sample of items was no one-dimensional measure of depressive states. However, a melancholia subscale of the HDS contained items the total of which can be used to compare patients quantitatively, although in some part of the analysis one of these items showed ceiling effect. It was concluded that the melancholia subscale (containing the items depressed mood, guilt, work and interests, retardation, psychic anxiety, and general somatic symptoms) can form the basis for further improvements in the field of quantitative rating scales for depressive states.",pubmed,0.8294866632015242

The aim in this study was to validate the MMSE in a healthy population and to provide normal scores. Internal construct validity of the Turkish version of MMSE among a preliminary sample of 406 normal people was assessed by Rasch unidimensional measurement model. Scores of the normal sample varied according to age and education but not according to sex. The data derived from this sample showed poor fit to the Rasch model (mean item fit, -2.082, SD 3.022). Only four of 11 items met model expectations. There was also differential item functioning by education and age for most items. Thus the internal construct validity of the Turkish MMSE in a normative sample could not be demonstrated by Rasch analysis. The scale failed modern psychometric criteria for scalability. We would therefore suggest other large normative MMSE data sets to be tested in terms of internal construct validity. If these findings are replicated, the validity of MMSE norms and their consequent use in clinical practice should be reconsidered.",pubmed,0.8008994379480928

It consists of three dimensions: persistent anxiety, episodic anxiety, and avoidance behavior. This study aimed to assess the measurement properties of the scale while controlling for the rater (self- vs. clinician-rated) effect. The Parkinson Anxiety Scale was administered to a cross-sectional multicenter international sample of 362 Parkinson's disease patients. Both patients and clinicians rated the patient's anxiety independently. A many-facet Rasch model design was applied to estimate and remove the rater effect. The following measurement properties were assessed: fit to the Rasch model, unidimensionality, reliability, differential item functioning, item local independency, interrater reliability (self or clinician), and scale targeting. In addition, test-retest stability, construct validity, precision, and diagnostic properties of the Parkinson Anxiety Scale were also analyzed. A good fit to the Rasch model was obtained for Parkinson Anxiety Scale dimensions A and B, after the removal of one item and rescoring of the response scale for certain items, whereas dimension C showed marginal fit. Self versus clinician rating differences were of small magnitude, with patients reporting higher anxiety levels than clinicians. The linear measure for Parkinson Anxiety Scale dimensions A and B showed good convergent construct with other anxiety measures and good diagnostic properties. Parkinson Anxiety Scale modified dimensions A and B provide valid and reliable measures of anxiety in Parkinson's disease that are comparable across raters.

2477,2720,Screening for multiple sclerosis cognitive impairment using a self-administered 15-item questionnaire.,,,"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)",,R H B Benedict,"Since there is a need for cost-effective screening techniques to identify neuropsychological impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and because existing methods require cognitive testing with subsequent interpretation by a neuropsychologist, a brief self-report procedure was developed to screen for neuropsychological impairment in MS. In the first phase of the study, a pool of 80 items was generated based on a literature review and consultation with healthcare professionals. The set was reduced to 15 via Rasch analysis. Using these items, a brief (five minute) MS Neuropsychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ), including patient- and informant-report forms, was composed. In phase II, 50 MS patients and their caregivers completed the MSNQ. A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was also administered. Analyses covered the reliability of the MSNQ and correlations between both patient- and informant-report scores and objective neuropsychological testing. Cronbach's alpha coefficients were 0.93 and 0.94 for the patient- and informant-report forms, respectively, and both forms of the test were strongly correlated with a more general cognitive complaints questionnaire. The patient MSNQ form correlated significantly with measures of depression but not with objective tests of cognitive function. In contrast, the informant form was correlated with patient cognitive performance but not depression. A cut-off score of 27 on the informant form of the MSNQ optimally separated patients based on a neuropsychological summary score encompassing measures of processing speed and memory. There were two false-negatives and one false-positive, giving the test a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity of 0.97. It is concluded, therefore, that this self-administered neuropsychological screening test is reliable and predicts neuropsychological impairment in MS patients with a reasonable degree of accuracy.",pubmed,0.7862960515140761

The EMUN-AR scale is one of such scales but it has not been validated.
Objective: To validate the EMUN-AR scale using Rasch models. 
Materials and methods: The EMUN-AR scale measures 26 items to assess comprehensively symptoms of manic-depressive illnesses in three domains: Frequency, severity, and level of disturbance caused by the symptoms. To test the psychometric properties of this scale, we used the exploratory factorial and Rasch analyses. The Rasch analysis included unidimensionality, reliability, item fit, threshold ordering, and person-item maps. 
Results: The study included 267 hospitalized patients, most of them with a manic episode diagnosis (n=204, 76.4%), and receiving pharmacological treatment. The factor structure was summarized in four domains: Activation, inhibition, depressive ideation, and maladaptive behavior. The Rasch analysis supported unidimensionality of the EMUN-AR factors, satisfactory levels of reliability, and appropriate item fit, except for one of the items measuring death or suicidal thoughts. However, the scale did not measure adequately the mild forms of the illness given its redundant and unordered thresholds.
Conclusion: The EMUN-AR was modified in two aspects: An item whose marginal indicators were poorly adjusted and the reduction in the number of categories. In its current form, the EMUN-AR is appropriate for measuring severe forms of the illnesses, but it does not adequately measure the mild forms of manic-depressive illnesses.",pubmed,0.7741948274774106

2741,3011,An analysis of dimensionality using factor analysis (true-score theory) and Rasch measurement: what is the difference? Which method is better?,,,Journal of applied measurement,,Russell F Waugh,"One often hears the question asked, ""For questionnaire data measuring a variable, what difference does it make to use factor analysis/principal components analysis (true-score theory) or Rasch measurement in testing for dimensionality?"" This paper reports both factor analysis and Rasch measurement analysis for two sets of data. One set of data measures social anxiety for primary school students (N=436, I=10) and the second measures attitude to mathematics for primary-aged students (N=774, I=10). For both sets of data, the factor analysis suggests that the scores are reliable, and that inferences can be made that are valid for measuring school anxiety and attitude to mathematics. For both sets of data analyzed with Rasch measurement techniques, the reliability of the measures, the dimensionality of the measures, and the initial conceptualisation of the items, are called into question. It suggests that one cannot make valid inferences from the measures that were initially set up for true-score theory. The Rasch analysis suggests that items intended to measure a variable should be initially developed on a conceptualized scale from easy to hard, and that students should answer the items from this perspective, so that the Rasch analysis of the data tests this conceptualisation, and a linear scale can be created based on a mathematical measurement model with consistent units (logits).",pubmed,0.7502616647042207

Internationale Zeitschrift fur Rehabilitationsforschung. Revue internationale de recherches de readaptation,10.1097/MRR.0b013e328343d4d3,Anna Simone,"ABILHAND is, in its original version, a 46-item, 4-level questionnaire. It measures the difficulty perceived by patients with rheumatoid arthritis as they do various daily manual tasks. ABILHAND was originally built through Rasch analysis. In a later study, it was simplified to a generic 23-item, three-level questionnaire, showing both cross-cultural (Belgium vs. Italy) and cross-impairment (rheumatoid arthritis vs. stroke) validity. Later research returned to the development of impairment-specific versions, with modified item sets and levels. Each version has its own Rasch-derived item difficulty calibrations, which are required to extract the patient's measure from the individual string of responses, through computerized algorithms. All of these hamper the practical application of the scale in rehabilitation units, where patients with diverse conditions may share similar impairments and treatment approaches. In this study through Rasch analysis the 'generic' scale was applied to 126 chronic patients with different upper limb impairments, and to 24 healthy controls. It was supported that the generic questionnaire remains valid across a variety of motor impairments. To further facilitate clinical application, a normative cut-off (>79 of 100) is suggested. Rasch-based item calibrations are provided together with a software routine designed to calculate, on individual patients, linear 0-100 measures and error estimates from the raw scores.",pubmed,0.7381417379632482

However, many older adults have significant visual impairment and there are currently no such word-finding tasks developed for use with older visually impaired populations. This study presents a verbal, non-visual measure of word-finding for use in the evaluation of older adults with possible dysnomia. Stimuli were chosen based on their frequency of usage in everyday spoken language. A 60-item scale was created and given to 131 older Veterans. Rasch analyses were conducted and differential item functioning assessed to eliminate poorly-performing items. The final 55-item scale had a coefficient alpha of 0.84 and correlated with the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery Naming test, r=0.84, p<.01, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Category Fluency, r=0.45, p<.01, and the D-KEFS Letter Fluency, r=0.40, p<.01. ROC analyses found the measure to have sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 85% for detecting dysnomia. Patients with dysnomia performed worse on the measure than patients with intact word-finding, t(84)=8.2, p<.001. Patients with no cognitive impairment performed significantly better than patients with mild cognitive impairment, who performed significantly better than patients with dementia. This new measure shows promise in the neuropsychological evaluation of word-finding ability in older adults with or without visual impairment.

This study was undertaken to develop and validate a new anxiety rating scale, the Parkinson Anxiety Scale (PAS), that would overcome the limitations of existing scales. The general structure of the PAS was based on the outcome of a Delphi procedure. Item selection was based on a canonical correlation analysis and a Rasch analysis of items of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) from a previously published study. Validation was done in a cross-sectional international multicenter study involving 362 patients with idiopathic PD. Patients underwent a single screening session in which the PAS was administered, along with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the HARS, and the BAI. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview was administered to establish Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnoses of anxiety and depressive disorders. The PAS is a 12-item observer or patient-rated scale with three subscales, for persistent, episodic anxiety and avoidance behavior. Properties for acceptability and reliability met predetermined criteria. The convergent and known groups validity was good. The scale has a satisfactory factorial structure. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve and Youden index of the PAS are higher than that of existing anxiety rating scales.

For the Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale (BRMES), among other advantages, the concept of unidimensionality was confirmed in patients with major depression by different methodological approaches including Rasch analysis. The present evaluation was designed to investigate the scale properties of the BRMES in acutely schizophrenic patients with particular emphasis on the dimensionality of the scale. Three different statistical approaches were used: principal component analysis in combination with computer simulation, polytomous Rasch analysis using advanced latent trait and latent class models and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) by means of linear structure model approaches. The statistical methods were applied to BRMES baseline data of 132 acutely schizophrenic patients with predominantly positive symptoms participating in a multi-center pharmacological trial. The different methodological approaches revealed converging results indicating: (1) a substantial proportion of acutely ill schizophrenic patients showed depressive symptoms; (2) the hypothesis of unidimensionality of the BRMES had to be rejected for the sample of acutely schizophrenic patients and (3) a three-factorial model of depressive symptoms as measured by the BRMES ('retardation', 'depressive core symptoms', 'unspecific depressive symptoms') yielded the best fit of the present data. Depression in acutely psychotic patients has to be considered rather as a heterogeneous construct than as a well-defined syndrome. The differentiation of depressive symptomatology should facilitate treatment evaluation and help to clarify relationships between different symptom classes in further studies.",pubmed,0.7197832375652848

Groups were matched on gender, race, education, Full Scale Intelligence Quotient, and Global Neuropsychological Deficit Score. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine structural equivalence. Score, variability, and reliability equivalency were also examined. Differential item and test functioning under a Rasch model were examined. <b>Results:</b> An identified factor structure from research of the HCT-OV fit the HCT-CV scores adequately: χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 8.83, <i>p</i> = .07; root mean square error of approximation = 0.10 [0.00, 0.20]; standardized root mean residual = 0.03; comparative fit index = 0.99.

Reliability estimates were, however, similar and adequate for clinical practice: 0.96 for HCT-OV and 0.97 for HCT-CV. About 17% of items showed possible differential item functioning, though just three of these items were statistically significant. Differential test functioning revealed expected total score differences of <1% between versions. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results of this study suggest that the HCT-CV functions similar to the HCT-OV with there being negligible differences in expected total scores between these versions.

The first analysis of the U.K. National Prion Monitoring Cohort involved 1337 scheduled clinical assessments and 479 telephone assessments in 437 participants over 373 patient-years of follow-up. Scale development has included semi-quantitative and qualitative carer interviews, item response modelling (Rasch analysis), inter-rater reliability testing, construct analysis and correlation with several existing scales. The proposed 20-point Medical Research Council prion disease rating scale assesses domains of cognitive function, speech, mobility, personal care/feeding and continence, according to their relative importance documented by carer interviews. It is quick and simple to administer, and has been validated for use by doctors and nurses and for use over the telephone, allowing for frequent assessments that capture the rapid change typical of these diseases. The Medical Research Council Scale correlates highly with widely used cognitive and single item scales, but has substantial advantages over these including minimal floor effects. Three clear patterns of decline were observed using the scale: fast linear decline, slow linear decline (usually inherited prion disease) and in some patients, decline followed by a prolonged preterminal plateau at very low functional levels. Rates of decline and progress through milestones measured using the scale vary between sporadic, acquired and inherited prion diseases following clinical expectations. We have developed and validated a new functionally-oriented outcome measure and propose that future clinical trials in prion disease should collect data compatible with this scale, to allow for combined and comparative analyses. Such approaches may be advantageous in orphan conditions, where single studies of feasible duration will often struggle to achieve statistical power.",pubmed,0.714990690898032

3591,3942,Rasch techniques for detecting bias in performance assessments: an example comparing the performance of native and non-native speakers on a test of academic English.,,,Journal of applied measurement,,Catherine Elder,"The use of common tasks and rating procedures when assessing the communicative skills of students from highly diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds poses particular measurement challenges, which have thus far received little research attention. If assessment tasks or criteria are found to function differentially for particular subpopulations within a test candidature with the same or a similar level of criterion ability, then the test is open to charges of bias in favour of one or other group. While there have been numerous studies involving dichotomous language test items (see e.g. Chen and Henning, 1985 and more recently Elder, 1996) few studies have considered the issue of bias in relation to performance based tasks which are assessed subjectively, via analytic and holistic rating scales. The paper demonstrates how Rasch analytic procedures can be applied to the investigation of item bias or differential item functioning (DIF) in both dichotomous and scalar items on a test of English for academic purposes. The data were gathered from a pilot English language test administered to a representative sample of undergraduate students (N= 139) enrolled in their first year of study at an English-medium university. The sample included native speakers of English who had completed up to 12 years of secondary schooling in their first language (L1) and immigrant students, mainly from Asian language backgrounds, with varying degrees of prior English language instruction and exposure. The purpose of the test was to diagnose the academic English needs of incoming undergraduates so that additional support could be offered to those deemed at risk of failure in their university study. Some of the tasks included in the assessment procedure involved objectively-scored items (measuring vocabulary knowledge, text-editing skills and reading and listening comprehension) whereas others (i.e. a report and an argumentative writing task) were subjectively-scored. The study models a methodology for estimating bias with both dichotomous and scalar items using the programs Quest (Adams and Khoo, 1993) for the former and ConQuest (Wu, Adams and Wilson, 1998) for the latter. It also offers answers to the practical questions of whether a common set of assessment criteria can, in an academic context such as this one, be meaningfully applied to all subgroups within the candidature and whether analytic criteria are more susceptible to biased ratings than holistic ones. Implications for test fairness and test validity are discussed.",pubmed,0.6972756035178175

The Rasch model was used to scale the items and specify the reliability of the test across the whole sample and within different groups of participants (female, male, students of gymnasium, and students of lyceum). This model showed that the test is highly reliable and invariant across groups. Cluster analysis and the saltus model were applied to uncover successive developmental stage-like levels of difficulty and showed the presence of five such levels.

This domain can be subdivided into items relevant for the severity of the depression and items relevant for the diagnosis of depression. It has been argued that Rasch models rather than multivariate analysis are the adequate models when studying the internal consistency of rating scales. Applying the Rasch models, it was found that 10 items have an additive relationship for the severity of depression and that 5 items were additively related for endogenous depression, whereas five other items were additively related for reactive depression. Moreover, it was found that the dimension of severity should be transformed to three categories: no depression, minor depression and major depression. The two dimensions: endogenous and reactive depression, respectively, should be transformed to the categories: definite endogenous depression, combined endogenous and reactive depression, definite reactive depression, probable endogenous depression and probable reactive depression. These categories for severity and for the diagnosis of depression have a high internal consistency. However, we still need studies to verify the external validity of these concepts.",pubmed,0.6955544741695533

We performed a secondary analysis of retrospective MDS data collected by the Department of Veteran Affairs Austin Automation Center. Items demonstrated unidimensionality and represented two separate constructs: physical functioning and cognition. The physical functioning items showed good psychometric properties and covered a wide range of residents' physical functioning, with the spread of items efficiently discriminating residents' performance into different physical functioning strata. In contrast, the psychometric properties of the cognition items were less sound, had severe ceiling effects, and did not efficiently discriminate residents' performance into different cognition strata. The constructed validity of the physical functioning and cognition scales of the MDS, in general, was supported. Future investigations into the function of the rating scale and the necessity of adding challenging items are recommended.",pubmed,0.6907959923432885

Adding neuropsychological tests to their scale might improve precision and accuracy in mild dementia. We, therefore, pooled neuropsychological test-batteries from two memory clinics (ns = 135 and 186) with CAMCOG data from a population study and 2 memory clinics (n = 829) and ADAS-cog data from 3 randomized controlled trials (n = 713) to estimate a common dimension of global cognitive ability using Rasch analysis. Item difficulties and individuals' global cognitive ability levels were estimated. Difficulties of 57 items (of 64) could be validly estimated. Neuropsychological tests were more difficult than the CAMCOG, ADAS-cog, and MMSE items. Most neuropsychological tests had difficulties in the ability range of normal ageing to mild dementia. Higher than average ability levels were more precisely measured when neuropsychological tests were added to the MMSE than when these were measured with the MMSE alone. Diagnostic accuracy in mild dementia was consistently better after adding neuropsychological tests to the MMSE.

The Bendep-SRQ, Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), Schedules for Clinical Assessments in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), and Addiction Severity Index-Revised (ASI-R) were administered to 115 general practice (GP) patients, 124 psychiatric outpatients, and 33 self-help patients who were using BZDs. Factor and Rasch analyses were applied to construct scales. Reliability assessments were made in terms of subject discriminability, item discriminability, and test-retest stability. To support the construct validity of the scales, theoretical rationales were required to explain the specific item order provided by the Rasch scale values. To assess the concurrent and discriminant validity, a matrix consisting of the above-mentioned measures was factor-analyzed. Four Rasch-homogeneous scales were delineated: problematic use, preoccupation, lack of compliance, and withdrawal. Nearly all subject discriminability, item discriminability, and test-retest results indicated good reliability. A BZD dependence factor was extracted with high loadings for the Bendep-SRQ scales and the concurrent measures. The discriminant measures had high loadings on other factors.

Ninety-eight outpatients undergoing psychotherapy were evaluated using a semistructured diagnostic interview for DSM-IV Personality disorders. Correlational analysis and Rasch analysis were used to identify the best-fitted items for the shorter scale. Rasch analysis identified three underfitted items. The best five items were selected for the Short-Bord using two analyses, resulting in two sets of Short-Bord which included item 1 (becoming frantic when someone left), item 2 (up- and- down relationships), item 3 (sudden change of sense of self), item 8 (self-harm or suicide), item 9 (self-mutilation), item 10 (sudden mood change) and item 11 (feeling empty inside). Each set of the five-item Short-Bord were tested against the original 15-item BPD scale. Results showed that both sets of the Short-Bord yielded minimally lower in area under curve (AUC = 0.95 and 0.96, respectively) compared with the total score of 15 items (AUC = 0.97), but none significantly differed (chi-square = 0.89-2.87, df 1, p >.05). Internal consistency for the set from Rasch analysis was slightly higher than correlation methods (Cronbach's alpha = 0.80, and 0.78, respectively). The Short-Bord presents promising tool to screen for borderline personality disorder. Its diagnostic validity was comparable to the total 15 items despite completing in a shorter time.

A modified scoring system was devised for the HVOT so that children received some credit for being able to describe the function of objects. The HVOT was administered to 630 typically developing school-aged children and 210 children with Down syndrome matched for age and education. Rasch analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve were applied. Rasch analysis of data from typically developing children showed that twelve items were candidates for deletion due to poor fit to the Rasch model, violation of normality and age-related item bias. Removing these items resulted in a shortened version with 18 items that forms a reliable and strong unidimensional, hierarchical scale. The items were well targeted to the ability level of the children tested. Area under the curve for HVOT-18 was 0.84, indicating very good ability to identify visual integration deficit in children with Down syndrome. The 18-item HVOT can be summed to produce an overall index of visual synthetic ability. Subsequent work is needed to validate its use in other childhood disabilities.",pubmed,0.670316477218675

Items on the positive/effective HPSS subscales targeted patients at low, moderate, and high levels of positive/effective problem solving, whereas items on the negative/ineffective problem solving subscales mostly targeted those at moderate or high levels of ineffective problem solving. Validity was examined by correlating factor scores on the measure with clinical and behavioral measures. Items on the HPSS show promise in the ability to assess health-related problem solving among high risk patients.

Subjects were 803 individuals in inpatient PTSD units at 10 VA sites. TST indicated that the M-PTSD performed well and could be improved slightly by deleting one item. Factor analysis using raw scores indicated that the reverse-scored items formed the second factor and had poor relationships with normally scored items. However, since item-total correlations supported their usefulness, they were kept. The subsequent Rasch analysis indicated that five of the seven worst fitting items were reverse-scored items. We concluded that using reversed items with disturbed patients can cause confusion that reduces reliability. Deleting them improved validity without loss of reliability. The study supports the use of Rasch analysis over TST in health research since it indicated ways to reduce respondent burden while maintaining reliability and improving validity.",pubmed,0.6676347171863413

Although we confirmed that our six-item HDS subscale, in contrast to the total 17-item HDS, was a one-dimensional measure of depression, the Rasch analysis showed that the weekly improvement in subscale scores only applied to the individual patient, i.e. an average improvement curve for a group of depressed patients is an abstraction to which the individual curves cannot be transferred. Our results indicate, however, that when the subscale scores are transformed into three clinical categories of depression: no, mild (minor), moderate/-severe (major) they could be described by a common improvement curve for all patients. This is illustrated by the percentage of patients who, week to week, changed from major to minor or no depression, or from minor to no depression. We found no specific improvement pattern for imipramine or clomipramine which could be used diagnostically. There is reason to assume that patients completing a controlled trial necessarily will follow a monotonic improvement curve, and the improvement pattern of all patients fulfilling the entry criteria should, therefore, always be reported. The present study thus indicates that calculation of average improvement curves is neither clinically nor statistically meaningful, and should be replaced by measures of changes in number of patients in different main severity categories, or by the final rating score. No difference in outcome between imipramine and clomipramine was shown neither on the subscale nor on the 17-item HDS.",pubmed,0.6640481706889418

Consistent with the results recently reported on the self-rated version of the DEX (DEX-S; Simblett & Bateman,  2011 ), Rasch analysis completed on 271 responses to the DEX-I revealed that the scale did not fit the Rasch model and did not meet the assumption of unidimensionality, that is, a single underlying construct could not be found for the DEX-I that would allow development of an interval-level measure as a whole. Subscales, based on theoretical conceptualisations of executive functioning (Stuss,  2007 ) previously suggested for the DEX-S, were able to demonstrate fit to the Rasch model and unidimensionality.

Potential advantages of CAT for clinical practice and research are efficient cognitive testing and a reduction of the test burden in elderly patients and consequently less measurement error during testing. In a two step method with previously collected CAMCOG data (n = 797) (1) patient abilities and CAMCOG item difficulties were estimated with the One Parameter Logistic Model (OPLM), a Rasch type of model. CAT was then used (2) to re-estimate the patient abilities. Despite an average test reduction of 60%, CAT estimates were in excellent agreement (intra-class correlation > 0.98) with the results based on the entire CAMCOG and they also had similar accuracy for the diagnosis of dementia (area under the curve 0.91) as the original CAMCOG. These results were replicated in an independent sample (n = 170). We conclude that tailored testing with CAT enables much more efficient screening for dementia than testing with an extensive instrument.",pubmed,0.638983263071573

Health disparities persist when assessments do not appropriately measure different populations' mental health problems. To address this assessment issue, we conducted principal axis factoring, confirmatory factor analysis, and Rasch analyses to assess the psychometric characteristics of the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) to evaluate whether the BSI is culturally appropriate for assessing African American students' psychological distress. The dimensional structure of the BSI was first identified and held up under cross-validation with a second sample and a white sample. The measure was unidimensional among African American and white students. Our results suggested BSI in our samples presented characteristics such as low person separation, stability across samples, and little differential item functioning. Most African American and white students identified themselves on the low end of the categories in a 0-4 rating scale, indicating their low endorsement of the items on the BSI. Rasch analyses were completed with the original scale but also collapsing the scale to three points, with some increase in separation and reliability for the collapsed scale.

Method Participants with osteoarthritis of the knee completed the beck depression inventory (BDI-II), state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI), arthritis helplessness index (AHI), fatigue severity scale (FSS), coping strategies questionnaire (CSQ), beliefs about pain control questionnaire (BPCQ), illness perceptions questionnaire-revised (IPQ-R), pain self-efficacy questionnaire (PSEQ) at home as part of a set of measures covering different aspects of osteoarthritis pain. The questionnaires were returned by pre-paid envelope. Rasch analysis was used to check the psychometric properties of the scales in people with osteoarthritis. Results The STAI-SF was an acceptable measure of anxiety and the revised FSS an acceptable measure of fatigue, with removal of items 1 and 2. The BDI subscales were acceptable for measuring negative thoughts and behaviours related to depressive symptomatology with some modifications to the scale. The helplessness scale of the AHI was acceptable as a measure of helplessness. The PSEQ was an acceptable measure of self-efficacy and the CSQ as a measure of cognitive coping strategies. The BPCQ and IPQ-R did not fit the Rasch model. Conclusions These findings indicate that questionnaires need to be checked for their ability to measure psychological constructs in the clinical groups to which they will be applied.

Rasch analysis was undertaken on the responses of 363 people with ABI to the DEX. Overall, the questionnaire did not perform as a unidimensional, interval-level scale of executive functioning, suggesting that it measures more than one psychological construct. Most subscales previously proposed using factor analysis, including those suggested in the DEX manual, did not perform as unidimensional interval-level scales either.

The 20-item Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP-Q) is the only instrument that assesses nomophobia with an underlying theoretical structure and robust psychometric testing. This study aimed to confirm the construct validity of the Persian NMP-Q using Rasch and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models. Methods After ensuring the linguistic validity, Rasch models were used to examine the unidimensionality of each Persian NMP-Q factor among 3,216 Iranian adolescents and CFAs were used to confirm its four-factor structure. Differential item functioning (DIF) and multigroup CFA were used to examine whether males and females interpreted the NMP-Q similarly, including item content and NMP-Q structure. Results Each factor was unidimensional according to the Rach findings, and the four-factor structure was supported by CFA. Two items did not quite fit the Rasch models (Item 14: ""I would be nervous because I could not know if someone had tried to get a hold of me;"" Item 9: ""If I could not check my smartphone for a while, I would feel a desire to check it""). No DIF items were found across gender and measurement invariance was supported in multigroup CFA across gender. Conclusions Due to the satisfactory psychometric properties, it is concluded that the Persian NMP-Q can be used to assess nomophobia among adolescents. Moreover, NMP-Q users may compare its scores between genders in the knowledge that there are no score differences contributed by different understandings of NMP-Q items.",pubmed,0.6063090595899642

Data were derived from the OPTiMiSE trial comprising 446 patients with first-episode schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder. Using the Rasch Model to examine psychometric properties of the PANSS negative subscale, we found that the composite score across items was not an adequate measure of negative symptom severity.

2789,3059,[Methodological problems of clinical trials of psychotropic drugs (author's transl)].,,,Archiv fur Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten,,H Heimann,"Up to now, clinical studies only succeeded in differentiating between great categories of psychotropic drugs, but failed to prove finer differences of effects within these categories of substances. Two points of the testing-method are discussed: 1. problems which arise when rating pathological behaviour and 2. problems of sampling psychiatric patients. A great part of symptoms that clinicians and psychologists used to consider as relevant proved to be extremely rare. Total scores cannot be taken as a measure of the therapeutic effect, because they don't express adequately the degree of severity of the illness before and after treatment, and there is a symptom that is independent from the observer, i.e. the frequency of the symptom in different clinical pictures. The frequency is an inverse ratio to the specificity of the symptom. It is then argued that even in clinical studies, it would be possible to choose among the variety of descriptive symptoms those which fulfil requirements of the probabilistic test-model of Rasch and to take only those symptoms to characterize the degree of severity of psychic disturbance in trials with psychotropic drugs. Conclusions are then drawn from a study including three groups of physicians (specialists for internal diseases, psychiatrists and general practitioners): failure to differentiate between placebo and a Minor-Tranquilizer was not due to the inefficiency of the drug, but ought to be attributed to the lack of sharpness of the observations made by untrained judges. A significant difference between placebo and the Minor-Tranquilizer was yet found, but only in the group of psychiatrists. The comparison of the first 13 and the last 13 cases in the two remaining groups, however, reveals a learning process in the course of the study. The main problems of sampling are discussed, i.e.: the loss of information as a consequence of taking the mean in a group of psychiatric patients, the role of biological rhythms, which was hitherto insufficiently considered, and finally it is demonstrated in connection with two selected cases of depressive patients that enormous difference of psychophysiological responsiveness can be hidden behind very similar clinical pictures. It is pointed out that the existing research strategy is adjusted to great samples, which were composed on the basis of behavioral characteristics, and that it failed to differentiate subtle effects of psychotropic drugs. Only experiments involving a much greater display, which take into account all aspects of observation of the selected single cases and longitudinal studies can answer the question which is the right medicine for the right patient.

However, Rasch-modeling dichotomized data led to good fit for both normal (n = 219) and Traumatic Brain Injury (n = 54) samples and generalized validity for these groups, as well as for male and female groups. The logarithmic transformation of the item and person data performed by the model converts the ordinal data to yield interval scaled data.

1663,1825,Overview of methodological issues in the study of chronic care populations.,,,Alzheimer disease and associated disorders,,J Teresi,"The intent of the methodology section of this volume was to provide an overview of recent thinking about analytic techniques that can be used to study chronic care populations, particularly dementia SCUs. As discussed earlier in this article, although not unique to these populations, longitudinal analysis of chronic care populations frequently involves several problems: nonequivalent comparison groups, unbalanced designs, censoring and attrition, autocorrelation (correlated repeated measures) and heterogeneous correlations across repeated measures. The last 5 years has witnessed considerable change and growth in the development of longitudinal modelling methodologies. Although developments in modelling cut across disciplines, there has been a focus on certain types of methods in several fields of applied statistics: psychometrics (e.g., analysis of change, item response theory, Rasch modelling of binary outcomes), mathematical sociology (e.g., structural equation modelling), demography (e.g., transition modelling), epidemiology (e.g., risk modelling), and biostatistics (e.g., examination of intervention effects using marginal and random effects modelling of repeated measures). An important issue is the interrelationship between measurement and outcome assessment. Source of measurement error must be considered (see Zimmerman and Magaziner in this volume), as must bias in assessments (see Teresi and Golden in this volume). While it has long been known that poor measurement can attenuate and bias estimates of longitudinal effects, the answer is not to attempt artificial solutions through use of corrections for attenuation (unreliability). Design and sampling issues are also critical to the correct conduct of any longitudinal study. Otherwise, estimates of prevalence, incidence, and intervention effects will be in error (see Beckett and Evans, in this volume). Several modelling approaches have been reviewed. Different points of view regarding change analysis have been presented; controversy remains regarding the ""best"" methods for examining change (see the commentary by Rogosa in this volume). Theory building using methods such as structural equation modelling remains a staple of longitudinal analysis, although several caveats have been discussed. New or revisited methodologies (random effects modelling, of which growth curve analysis can be viewed as a special case and event history modelling) offer promise in dealing with the knotty problems inherent in the longitudinal study of chronic care populations, namely, censoring, attrition, and unbalanced designs resulting in missing data (see the commentary by Nesselroade, in this issue). However, it remains clear that no one model or approach will be optimal for all applications.",pubmed,0.5824819335928467

Concept elicitation and cognitive interviews (qualitative methods) were used to identify and refine symptom concepts. Classical test theory and Rasch measurement theory (quantitative methods) were used to evaluate item-level and scale-level performance of the PAL-I using an iterative approach between qualitative and quantitative methods. Patients with cLBP participated in concept elicitation interviews (N = 43), cognitive interviews (N = 38), and assessment of paper-to-electronic format equivalence (N = 8). A web-based sample of self-reported patients with cLBP participated in quantitative studies to evaluate preliminary (N = 598) and revised (n = 401) drafts and patients with physician-diagnosed cLBP (N = 45) participated in preliminary validation of the PAL-I. The instrument contained 9 items describing cLBP impacts (walking, sitting, standing, lifting, sleep, social activities, travelling, climbing, and body movements). Item-level performance, scale structure, and scoring seemed to be appropriate. One-week test-retest reproducibility was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.88 [95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.94]). Convergent validity was demonstrated with PAL-I total score and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (Pearson correlation 0.82), MOS-36 Physical Functioning (-0.71), and MOS-36 Bodily Pain (-0.71). Individual item scores and total score discriminated between numeric rating scale tertile groups and painDETECT categories. Interpretation of paper and electronic administration modes was equivalent.

This study investigated the psychometric properties of a revised version of the measure (DEX-R), a comprehensive tool, grounded in current theoretical conceptualisations of frontal lobe function and dysexecutive problems. The aim was to improve measurement of dysexecutive problems following acquired brain injury (ABI). Responses to the DEX-R were collected from 136 men and women who had experienced an ABI (the majority of whom had experienced a stroke or subarachnoid haemorrhage) and where possible, one of their carers or family members (n = 71), who acted as an informant. Rasch analysis techniques were employed to explore the psychometric properties of four newly developed, theoretically distinct subscales based on Stuss model of frontal lobe function and to evaluate the comparative validity and reliability of self and informant ratings of these four subscales. The newly developed subscales were well targeted to the range of dysexecutive problems reported by the current sample and each displayed a good level of internal validity. Both self- and independent-ratings were found to be performing reliably as outcome measures for at least a group-level. This new version of the tool could help guide selection of interventions for different types of dysexecutive problems and provide accurate measurement in neurorehabilitation services.",pubmed,0.5800261116995803

2213,2429,Screening for somatization and hypochondriasis in primary care and neurological in-patients: a seven-item scale for hypochondriasis and somatization.,,,Journal of psychosomatic research,,P Fink,"The aim of this study was to investigate the internal and external validity of the Whiteley Index as a screening instrument for somatization illness. A 14-item version of the Whiteley Index for hypochondriacal traits was given to 99 of 191 consecutive primary care patients, aged 18-65 years, and to 100 consecutive patients, aged 18-60 years, admitted for the first time to a neurological ward. The primary care sample was, in addition, interviewed by means of the SCAN (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry) psychiatric interview. The GPs and the neurologists were asked to rate various characteristics of the patients that might indicate somatization. The internal validity of the Whiteley Index was tested by means of latent structure analysis. On this basis, a reduced seven-item scale (Whiteley-7 scale) and two subscales (i.e., an Illness Conviction and Illness Worrying scale, each with three items) were constructed. All three had a high internal validity fitting into the very restricted Rasch statistical model (p>0.05) and an acceptable transferability between most of the subpopulations investigated. In the primary care population, the Whiteley-7 and the Illness Conviction scales at cut-point 0/1 showed 1.00 and 0.87 sensitivity and 0.65 and 0.87 specificity, respectively, using as ""gold standard"" the fulfillment of criteria for at least one ICD-10 somatoform disorder, and 0.71 and 0.63 sensitivity and 0.62 and 0.87 specificity, respectively, as gold standard for the fulfillment of criteria for at least one DSM-IV somatoform disorder, excluding the NOS diagnostic group. The Illness Worrying subscale showed less impressive performance in this respect. The agreement between the Whiteley-7 scale including the two subscales and neurologists' rating and the GPs' rating and the somatization subscale on the SCL-90 was modest or worse. It may be concluded that the Whiteley-7 scale and the Illness Conviction subscale had acceptable psychometric profiles, and both seem to be promising screening tools for not only hypochondriasis but also for somatoform disorders in general.",pubmed,0.5748038083204154

Therefore, the main objective of the present set of studies was the development and validation of a new measure to assess decision-making in everyday moral conflict situations. All vignettes required a decision between an altruistic versus an egoistic behavioral response alternative. In three independent surveys (N = 200), we developed a 40-items measure with preferable mean rates of altruistic decisions (Study 1), clear representation of altruistic and egoistic response classes (Study 2), unambiguousness of social closeness classifications (socially close vs. socially distant protagonists; Studies 1 and 2), and high similarity to reality ratings (Studies 1 and 2). Additionally, we developed two parallelized item sets for future use in within-subjects design studies and investigated the measurement properties of our new scale (Studies 1 and 3). Results of Rasch model analyses and classical test theory fit indices showed unidimensionality and confirmed the appropriateness of the fragmentation into two parallelized item sets. Notably, in our data, there were neither effects of social closeness nor gender on the percentage of altruistic decisions.

3610,3961,A short measure of balance in multiple sclerosis: validation through Rasch analysis.,,,Functional neurology,,L Tesio,"Ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) frequently present with poor balance. Neither static nor dynamic posturography explore balance during self-paced movements in real-life activities, when fall is most probable. Behavioural item-response scales can easily represent these activities. However, testing many items can easily cause fatigue in MS patients, thus distorting their scores. On the other hand, the lower the number of items, the lower the precision of the cumulative score and its reliability. A new short instrument was derived from existing ones (the Tinetti and the Berg balance scales). A preliminary 10-item version encompassed sit/stand manoeuvres, standing with eyes open and closed, standing with eyes closed and head extended, leaning forward while standing, picking up an object from floor, resisting nudges on the sternum, turning around, tandem stance. The instrument was administered 1-3 times to 55 MS patients (103 observations overall), all of them able to walk autonomously for at least 20 metres. The Rasch Analysis was adopted to explore the psychometric validity of the scale. Two items (Stand-to-sit and Standing with eyes open) were deleted, as they were too easy and thus uninformative. The remaining 8 items made up a scale (called EQUI-SCALE) complying with the requirements of unidimensionality and reliability. The item scores remained stable in a sub-sample of 24 patients tested before and after ten 1-hour exercise sessions, thus supporting the homogeneity of the items.",pubmed,0.5620015765510035

Rasch analyses of the responses resulted in evidence for the content and construct validity of the retained items. However, the scope of that study did not allow for extensive examination of individual item characteristics, group analyses of participants, or the provision of testing and scoring materials or raw data, thereby limiting the ability of researchers to administer the test to Spanish-English bilinguals and to score the items with confidence. In this study, we present the in-depth information described above on the basis of further analyses, including (1) online searchable spreadsheets with extensive empirical (e.g., accuracy and name agreeability) and psycholinguistic item statistics; (2) answer sheets and instructions for scoring and interpreting the responses to the Rasch items; (3) tables of alternative correct responses for English and Spanish; (4) ability strata determined for all naming conditions (English and Spanish nouns and verbs); and (5) comparisons of accuracy across proficiency groups (i.e., Spanish dominant, English dominant, and balanced). These data indicate that the Rasch items from An Object and Action Naming Battery are valid and sensitive for the evaluation of naming in young Spanish-English bilingual adults.

Multidimensional skill profiles offer additional information beyond what a single test score can provide, if the reported skills can be identified and distinguished reliably. Many recent approaches to skill profile models are limited to dichotomous data and have made use of computationally intensive estimation methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, since standard maximum likelihood (ML) estimation techniques were deemed infeasible. This paper presents a general diagnostic model (GDM) that can be estimated with standard ML techniques and applies to polytomous response variables as well as to skills with two or more proficiency levels. The paper uses one member of a larger class of diagnostic models, a compensatory diagnostic model for dichotomous and partial credit data. Many well-known models, such as univariate and multivariate versions of the Rasch model and the two-parameter logistic item response theory model, the generalized partial credit model, as well as a variety of skill profile models, are special cases of this GDM. In addition to an introduction to this model, the paper presents a parameter recovery study using simulated data and an application to real data from the field test for TOEFL Internet-based testing.",pubmed,0.5497153957029696

A sample of 1426 students from first to eighth grades answered the instrument. The Partial Credits model was used to estimate the ability of the subjects and item difficulties on a common scale for each of the four factors, indicating which items required a higher level of creativity to be scored and will differentiate the more creative individuals. The results demonstrated that the greater part of the characteristics showed good fit indices, with values between 0.80 and 1.30 both infit and outfit, indicating a response pattern consistent with the model. The characteristics of Unusual Perspective, Expression of Emotion and Originality have been identified as better predictors of creative performance because requires greater ability level (usually above two standard deviation). These results may be used in the future development of an instrument's reduced form or simplification of the current correction model. ",pubmed,0.5463095174005983

Few studies have provided normative data for this measure, and minimal data are available regarding the impact of sociodemographic factors on test scores. This study presents normative data for the BSIT in a sample of English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic and non-Hispanic Whites. A Rasch analysis was also conducted to identify the items that best discriminated between varying levels of olfactory functioning, as measured by the BSIT. The total sample included 302 older adults seen as part of an ongoing study of rural cognitive aging, Project FRONTIER. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that BSIT scores require adjustment by age and gender, but years of education, ethnicity, and language did not significantly influence BSIT performance. Four items best discriminated between varying levels of smell identification, accounting for 59.44% of total information provided by the measure. However, items did not represent a continuum of difficulty on the BSIT. The results of this study indicate that the BSIT appears to be well-suited for assessing odor identification deficits in older adults of diverse backgrounds, but that fine-tuning of this instrument may be recommended in light of its items' difficulty and discrimination parameters. Clinical and empirical implications are discussed. ",pubmed,0.5383462061483277

The resulting neuropsychological and behavioural data were analysed by Rasch analysis. ALS patients showed a similar profile to bvFTD patients on tests of working memory, inhibitory control and behavioural measures. Nine ALS patients (45%) had cognitive impairment and five (25%) met criteria for bvFTD. Even in a subset of MND patients with no impairment on the ACE-R, subtle impairment of inhibitory control together with moderate to severe apathy, were found. The Rasch analysis confirmed that all patients could be ranked on the same continuum, based on their neuropsychological performance and behaviour. Thus, the cognitive and behavioural profiles of ALS mirror those seen in bvFTD. Impaired inhibitory control and behavioural changes suggest subtle orbitofrontal dysfunction in ALS.

Analysis of the item variants reveals similar scale outcomes and correlations with achievement but preference for the Likert variant when test information is considered. A hierarchical analysis using facet models reveals that the data fit significantly better in a model that incorporates an interaction effect between the country and the item delta parameters.

However, the validity of comparisons of Autism Spectrum Quotient scores between groups may be threatened by differential item functioning. Differential item functioning entails a bias in items, where participants with equal values of the latent trait give different answers because of their group membership. In this article, items of the Autism Spectrum Quotient were studied for differential item functioning between different groups within a single sample (<i>N</i> = 408). Three analyses were conducted. First, using a Rasch mixture model, two latent groups were detected that show differential item functioning. Second, using a Rasch regression tree model, four groups were found that show differential item functioning: men without autism, women without autism, people 50 years and younger with autism, and people older than 50 years with autism. Third, using traditional methods, differential item functioning was detected between groups with and without autism. Therefore, group comparisons with the Autism Spectrum Quotient are at risk of being affected by bias. Eight items emerged that consistently show differences in response tendencies between groups across analyses, and these items were generally negatively phrased. Two often-used short forms of the Autism Spectrum Quotient, the AQ-28 and AQ-10, may be more suitable for group comparisons.",pubmed,0.526686023069826

In previous research, the SSS was found to measure two broad dimensions of stress (a) a General Worry factor and (b) a factor that tapped concerns about Negative Interpersonal Relations (Bramston & Fogarty, 1995). The present study sought to continue this line of research by introducing a slightly modified form of the SSS, to be known as the Lifestress Inventory (LI) and examining the psychometric properties of the scale when administered to a new sample of 221 people with mild intellectual disabilities. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that three underlying factors corresponding to General Worry, Negative Interpersonal Relations, and Coping were sufficient to account for the correlations among the items in the LI. Rasch analysis indicated some improvements to the scoring format for the LI and also showed that the most easily experienced stressors were associated with the Negative Interpersonal Relations dimension. The refinements introduced by the LI and the further demonstration that some of the broad stress dimensions identified in the general population can also be found in people with an intellectual disability represent important milestones for researchers interested in exploring reactions to stress among this population.",pubmed,0.509696627930142

4426,4858,A computer-based reading test for use as an index of premorbid general intellectual level in North American English-speaking adults.,,,Neurotoxicology,,Richard Letz,"Brief tests of vocabulary or reading ability are often used as an index of general intellectual level to hypothesize deficits in patients, to establish comparability of comparison groups, and as a covariate of performance on other neuropsychological tests. We evaluated a new variant of a reading test for potential use in estimating premorbid general intellectual ability and implementation as a computerized-adaptive test. A total of 319 outpatients who participated in an epilepsy self-management study were tested on three occasions, completing the Wide-Range Achievement Test-3 (WRAT-3) Reading test at baseline and the NES3 Adult Reading Test (ART) at the 3-month follow-up. At the 6-month follow-up, some participants completed the ART and some the NES2 Vocabulary test. ART and WRAT-3 Reading scores obtained 3 months apart were highly correlated (r=0.87, n=179), while ART and NES2 Vocabulary scores were somewhat less correlated (r=0.80, n=61). The ART test-retest correlation was high (r=0.95, n=79). The ART distribution was spread out more evenly at the high end than that of the WRAT-3 Reading. ART score was significantly related to education, race, income, and examiner category, but was unrelated to age category and depression status. Non-significant gender differences were observed. An item-response theory (Rasch model) analysis showed good fit of the model to the observed data and yielded an improved ranking of the ART items in order of difficulty. The NES3 ART exhibited high reliability and strong association with WRAT-3 Reading. These results suggest that the NES3-ART may be useful as an index of general intellectual ability for comparison of groups and for use as a covariate in data analyses among English-speaking, North American adults. The Rasch model analysis provides a basis for implementing the ART as a computerized-adaptive test, which should improve its time efficiency and reduce participant burden in taking the test.",pubmed,0.5045966986707215

At 3 months after the index stroke, a research assistant administered the IQCODE to relatives of 284 Chinese patients with acute stroke who were consecutively admitted to a general hospital. A psychiatrist, who was blinded to the IQCODE scores, interviewed all 284 patients and made DSM-IV diagnosis of dementia, which served as the benchmark for judging the performance of IQCODE in screening dementia. The results suggest that the optimal IQCODE scoring scheme has 2 rather than the original 5 categories. Although the IQCODE was unidimensional overall, there was evidence of item redundancy, thus indicating that a shortened version is desirable.",pubmed,0.49727114619415214

Children with this disorder are often characterized by symptoms of inattention and/or impulsivity and hyperactivity, which can significantly impact on many aspects of their behaviour and performance. This study investigated the characteristics of the SWAN Rating Scale and its discrimination of ADHD subtypes. This instrument was developed by Swanson and his colleagues and measures attentiveness and hyperactivity on a continuum, from attention problems to positive attention skills, using a seven-point scale of behaviour: ""far below average"" to ""far above average"". The Australian Twin Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Study consists of questionnaire data collected from families in 1990/2007. The Rasch model was used to measure the characteristics of items from the SWAN Rating Scale; how well these items discriminated between those with and without ADHD. The prevalence of each subtype was found to be 5.3% for inattentive ADHD, 4.3% for hyperactive ADHD and 4.6% for combined ADHD. A total of 14.2% of the cohort appeared to have ADHD. While the inattentive items appeared to be consistent with each other in their measurement behaviour and response patterns, the hyperactive items were less consistent. Further, the combined subtype appeared to be an entirely different type, with unique features unlike the other two subtypes. Further work is needed to distinguish the diagnostic features of each subtype of ADHD.",pubmed,0.49436377055906855

In classical test theory such data cannot be used to confirm either the unidimensionality (i.e., quantitative differentiation with the poles left-handed and right-handed) or multidimensionality (i.e., typological differentiation between left-, right-, and mixed-handers) of this personal characteristic. This study uses item response theory models to test the construct validity of the EHI on an item level in order to gather empirical support for the differentiation of handedness as well as the appropriateness of the items and the response format. The EHI was given to 540 participants (303 male and 237 female) aged 17-37 years. Results of mixed-Rasch analyses revealed that the best model was a two-class solution; that is, left- and right-handers (types) with quantitative differences between persons. Hence, unlike earlier model tests, this rejects both the unidimensionality of the handedness construct and the need to consider so-called mixed-handers. It is proposed that mixed-Rasch analyses should be applied more frequently to test the construct validity of other as well as more extensive handedness questionnaires.",pubmed,0.491946887549156

J. Psychiatr. 144 (1987) 1184]) is one of the most widely used measures of gambling problems in epidemiological studies and clinical evaluations. In the current paper, we were able to examine the SOGS using a Rasch model with data obtained from a representative community sample and a large clinical sample. The SOGS demonstrated significant stability across community and clinical samples despite the sample differences in gambling behaviors and demographic characteristics. In the clinical sample, we demonstrated the significant agreement between DSM-IV- and SOGS-based estimates of each person's level of gambling problem severity. However, the relative severity of DSM-IV and SOGS symptoms suggests that the measures tap somewhat different and overlapping regions of the latent continuum. We estimate that the DSM-IV reliably separates three levels of gambling problem severity and provides corresponding cut scores for a SOGS scale composed of 15 sample-invariant items. Recommendations for a relaxed cut score on the DSM-IV and reduced set of SOGS items are discussed.",pubmed,0.48779695072585244

Although its scores show promising psychometric properties, less is known about whether different groups of gamers interpret the items similarly. This study aimed to verify the construct validity of the Persian IGDS-SF9 and examine the scores in relation to gender and hours spent online gaming among 2,363 Iranian adolescents. Methods Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Rasch analysis were used to examine the construct validity of the IGDS-SF9. The effects of gender and time spent online gaming per week were investigated by multigroup CFA and Rasch differential item functioning (DIF). Results The unidimensionality of the IGDS-SF9 was supported in both CFA and Rasch. However, Item 4 (fail to control or cease gaming activities) displayed DIF (DIF contrast = 0.55) slightly over the recommended cutoff in Rasch but was invariant in multigroup CFA across gender. Items 4 (DIF contrast = -0.67) and 9 (jeopardize or lose an important thing because of gaming activity; DIF contrast = 0.61) displayed DIF in Rasch and were non-invariant in multigroup CFA across time spent online gaming. Conclusions Given the Persian IGDS-SF9 was unidimensional, it is concluded that the instrument can be used to assess IGD severity. However, users of the instrument are cautioned concerning the comparisons of the sum scores of the IGDS-SF9 across gender and across adolescents spending different amounts of time online gaming.",pubmed,0.47795081987738264

251,278,The Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Scale in clinical trials of therapies for bipolar disorder: a 20-year review of its use as an outcome measure.,,,CNS drugs,,Per Bech,"Over the last two decades the Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Scale (MAS) has been used extensively in trials that have assessed the efficacy of treatments for bipolar disorder. The extent of its use makes it possible to evaluate the psychometric properties of the scale according to the principles of internal validity, reliability, and external validity. Studies of the internal validity of the MAS have demonstrated that the simple sum of the 11 items of the scale is a sufficient statistic for the assessment of the severity of manic states. Both factor analysis and latent structure analysis (the Rasch analysis) have been used to demonstrate this. The total score of the MAS has been standardised such that scores below 15 indicate hypomania, scores around 20 indicate moderate mania, and scores around 28 indicate severe mania. The inter-observer reliability has been found to be high in a number of studies conducted in various countries. The MAS has shown an acceptable external validity, in terms of both sensitivity and responsiveness. Thus, the MAS was found to be superior to the Clinical Global Impression scale with regard to responsiveness, and sensitivity has been found to be adequate, with the MAS able to demonstrate large drug-placebo differences. Based on pretreatment scores, trials of antimanic therapies can be classified into: (i) ultrashort (1 week) therapy of severe mania; (ii) short-term therapy (3 to 8 weeks) of moderate mania; (iii) short-term therapy of hypomanic or mixed bipolar states; and (iv) long-term (12 months) therapy of bipolar states. The responsiveness of MAS is such that the scale has been able to demonstrated that typical antipsychotics are effective as an ultrashort therapy of severe mania; that lithium and anticonvulsants are effective in the short-term therapy of moderate mania; and that atypical antipsychotics, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation seem to have promising effects in the short-term therapy of moderate mania. In contrast, the scale has been used to demonstrate that calcium antagonists (e.g. verapamil) are ineffective in the treatment of mania. MAS has also been used to add to the literature on the evidence-based effect of lithium as a short-term therapy for hypomania or mixed bipolar states and as a long-term therapy of bipolar states.",pubmed,0.4659459792198133

Next, we have discussed one of the prevailing scales for headache, the Waters Headache Questionnaire (WHQ), with a multiaxial approach. The WHQ thus contains a severity axis, a diagnostic axis, and a personality axis. Previous studies on the validity of the WHQ, including factor analysis, have shown that migraine and muscular headaches are not mutually exclusive categories. Studies to validate a two-dimensional diagnostic system of migraine and non-migraine headache by Rasch models are discussed. In the field of personality it was suggested, when using questionnaires like the WHQ, to focus on the concepts of acquiescence and dissimulation. Supplemental axes such as ""severity of psychosocial stressors"" and ""social functioning"" or ""quality of life"" should be considered in future research.",pubmed,0.45323064355294157

Deficits in imitation ability in persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from toddlerhood into adulthood have also been repeatedly documented, raising the possibility that early disruptions in imitation contribute to the onset of ASD and the deficits in language and social interaction that define the disorder. This study prospectively examined the development of imitation between 12 and 24 months of age in 154 infants at familial risk for ASD and 78 typically developing infants who were all later assessed at 36 months for ASD or other developmental delays. The study established a developmental measure of imitation ability and examined group differences over time, using an analytic Rasch measurement model. Results revealed a unidimensional latent construct of imitation and verified a reliable sequence of imitation skills that was invariant over time for all outcome groups. Results also showed that all groups displayed similar significant linear increases in imitation ability between 12 and 24 months and that these increases were related to individual growth in both expressive language and ratings of social engagement but not in fine motor development. The group of children who developed ASD by age 3 years exhibited delayed imitation development compared with the low-risk typical outcome group across all time-points, but were indistinguishable from other high-risk infants who showed other cognitive delays not related to ASD.",pubmed,0.4242571316571677

This shortened version of the SOGS performed uniformly across a sample of pathological gamblers and a sample of students and resulted in five levels of discrimination and the following interpretation: a score of 1 reveals potential for problems; 2 reveals likely problem gambling; 3 or 4 items endorsed represent significant levels of problems noticeable by others; while 5 or 6 represents severe problems with significant financial involvement.

Narrative skill is strongly predictive of later language and literacy and is emphasized in curricula and educational standards. However, the need to transcribe a child's narrative and the lack of psychometrically justified scoring methods have precluded broad consideration of narrative skill among practitioners. We describe the development and validation of the Narrative Assessment Protocol-2 (NAP-2), an assessment of narrative skill for children ages 3-6 years, which uses event-based frequency scoring directly from a video recording of a child's narrative. Method The NAP-2 underwent a rigorous development process involving creation of four wordless picture books and associated scripts and identification of a broad item pool, including aspects of narrative microstructure and macrostructure. We collected two narratives from each of 470 children using the NAP-2 elicitation materials and scored each with the 60 items in the initial item pool. Results Cross-validated exploratory factor analyses indicated a single narrative skill factor. Rasch measurement analysis led to selection of 20 items that maintained high reliability while having good fit to the model and no evidence of differential item functioning across books and gender. Conclusions The NAP-2 offers a psychometrically sound and easy-to-use assessment of narrative skill for children ages 3-6 years. The NAP-2 is available freely online for use by speech-language pathologists, educational practitioners, and researchers.

Rasch and factor analyses assessed whether common conceptual development underlies higher-order false-belief understanding, social understanding, emotion recognition, and perspective-taking abilities. The results refuted a unidimensional scale and revealed three distinct AToM factors: social reasoning, reasoning about ambiguity, and recognizing transgressions of social norms. Developmental progressions emerged for the two reasoning factors but not for recognizing transgressions of social norms. Both social factors were significantly related to inhibition, whereas language development only predicted performance on social reasoning. These findings suggest that AToM comprises multiple abilities, which are subject to distinct cognitive influences. Importantly, only two AToM factors involve conceptual development.",pubmed,0.4184053072317212

The Boston Naming Test (BNT; Kaplan, Goodglass, & Weintraub, 1983 )is a widely used scale for clinical assessments of language function, but it is not suitable to assess bilinguals. Rasch analysis provides a unique and powerful method to establish measurement invariance across language groups that improves reliability of measurement. Method Rasch analysis was applied to a sample ( n = 215) of English or French monolingual and bilingual speakers completing the BNT in either language. Participants included English-French bilinguals ( n = 83), English monolinguals ( n = 72), and French monolinguals ( n = 60). Results The best overall Rasch model fit was obtained after the removal of 22 misfitting items, resulting in a 38-item BNT solution (BNT-38), with a modification of 7 items that showed differential item functioning by language factor. To increase the clinical utility of the BNT-38 in French speakers and bilinguals, we generated ordinal-to-interval conversion tables for monolinguals and bilinguals in English and French. Conclusions Use of the BNT-38 and the associated conversion tables will allow valid comparisons of naming abilities across bilingual and monolingual English and French speakers of different age groups. Applying these tools increases accuracy in measurement of naming ability and higher diagnostic precision in French and English monolinguals and bilinguals.",pubmed,0.4179527815621581

495,548,"Schizotypy, marijuana, and differential item functioning.",,,Human psychopharmacology,,Mitch Earleywine,"At least five studies report elevated schizotypy scores in cannabis users. The current research confirms higher schizotypy scores in regular cannabis users. Nevertheless, further analyses reveal that select items on the brief version of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire do not function comparably in current and former users. Multiple statistical approaches confirmed this problem, including the Mantel-Haenszel statistic, Rasch difficulty estimates, a logistic regression approach, the Breslow-Day (BD) statistic, and a combined decision rule using Mantel-Haenszel and BD together. Cannabis users appear to misinterpret at least one item, ""I sometimes use words in unusual ways"" making them more likely to endorse it even if they are no more schizotypal than the former users. Users might consider cannabis-related slang as an unusual use of words. Removing problematic items does not decrease the internal consistency of the measure, but eliminates the significant difference between current and former users. These results suggest that links between cannabis use and schizotypy require cautious interpretation and may arise from measurement problems.",pubmed,0.3955982784089871

We aimed to investigate the predictive accuracy of the TOPF and examine this word list at an item level against WASI-II scores, using Australian pronunciations. The sample of 219 healthy Australians were aged 18-82 years. Multiple regression analyses were used to replicate the TOPF and simple demographic models based on the US TOPF standardization. Rasch analyses provided a comparison of Australian, US and UK word order from the proportion of words pronounced correctly. The variance explained in WASI-II index scores ranged from R<sup>2</sup>=.12 (PRI) to .33 (FSIQ-2), which was approximately half that reported in the US standardization study. The accuracy of predicted WASI-II scores was also slightly less in our sample. Thirty-two words were out of place by five places or more compared with the US word order and 30 compared with the UK. These results add to concerns about the application the TOPF with norms developed in the US and UK in the Australian context.

The long-term consolidation of memories relies on memory reactivations during sleep. We investigated in SAD patients and healthy controls the role of memory reactivations during sleep in the long-term consolidation of positive and negative information. Socially anxious and healthy children and adolescents learnt associations between pictures showing ambiguous situations and positive or negative words defining the situations' outcome. Half of the words were re-presented during postlearning sleep (i.e., they were cued). Recall of picture-word associations and subjective ratings of pleasantness and arousal in response to the pictures was tested for cued and uncued stimuli. In the morning after cueing, cueing facilitated retention of positive and negative memories equally well in SAD patients and healthy controls. One week later, cueing led to reduced ratings of pleasantness of negative information in SAD but not in healthy controls. Coincidental to these findings was more pronounced EEG theta activity over frontal, temporal and parietal regions in response to negative stimuli in SAD patients. Our findings suggest that the preferential abstraction of negative emotional information during sleep might represent one factor underlying the negative memory bias in SAD.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We aim to uncover mechanisms underlying the characteristic negative memory bias in social anxiety disorder (SAD). The formation of long-lasting memories-a process referred to as memory consolidation-depends on the reactivation of newly acquired memories during sleep. We demonstrated that experimentally induced memory reactivation during sleep renders long-term memories of negative experiences more negative in SAD patients but not in healthy controls. We also found in SAD patients that the reactivation of negative experiences coincided with more pronounced oscillatory theta activity. These results provide first evidence that memory reactivation during sleep might contribute to the negative memory bias in SAD.",pubmed,0.39251699617174307

Methods:  582 children, of both sexes, aged between 3 and 5 years and residents in the city of Maringá (state of Paraná, Southern Brazil) participated in the study. Data were collected from May/2014 to June/2015 and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.  Results:  The evidence obtained from exploratory factor analysis indicated the presence of two factors, which was the option that best fitted the explanatory model. Hence, it was necessary to regroup the motor tasks of the dimensions “Aiming &amp; catching” and “Balance” into only one dimension. It is noteworthy that the “Bicycle trail” motor task did not fit the model, as it presented a low and negative factor load in the analyzed dimensions. In the confirmatory factor analysis, adequate adjustment indices were observed for the tested model, which confirmed the non-classification of the “Bicycle trail” motor task in the original dimension.  Conclusions:  After removing the “Bicycle trail” motor task, the adjusted two-factor model seems to be the most appropriate to assess the motor performance of children participating in the study.</jats:p>",crossref,0.37965678333070935

The validity evidence included Rasch-based, criterion-referenced item mapping, correlations with other clinical measures of memory, and prediction of reading and mathematics scores. The item mapping clearly demonstrates a parallel between increasing item difficulty and a progression of item characteristics that placed increasing demands on verbal and nonverbal working memory. The higher correlations of the SB5 verbal and nonverbal working memory subtests with other measures of verbal and nonverbal memory, respectively, and lower correlations with nonverbal and verbal memory measures, respectively, clearly show convergent and divergent validity. The higher correlations between SB5 verbal working memory and reading skills and between SB5 nonverbal memory and mathematics skills are consistent with past research.",pubmed,0.33763717523782366

We describe the statistical model and the strategy we adopted to score the GNAT, and we emphasize that, when analyzing implicit measures, MFRM indexes have to be interpreted in a peculiar way. In comparison with traditional scoring algorithms, an MFRM analysis of implicit measures provides some additional information and suffers from fewer limitations and assumptions. MFRM might help to overcome some limitations of current implicit measures, since it directly addresses some known issues and potential confounds, such as those related to a rational zero point, to the arbitrariness of the metric, and to participants' task-set switching ability.",pubmed,0.3265866202712098
