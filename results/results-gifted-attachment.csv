684,1142,The roots of creativity.,,,American journal of psychoanalysis,,,"The various factors which seem to be important in the creative child with extraordinary potential include: A good biologic endowment, often with high intelligence and a correlation between special sensory sensitivities and other physical requirements to implement the special interest. There is also sometimes the capacity to utilize or else compensate for deficit. The fostering of interests by a parent or interested adult. Specific kinds of ongoing encouragement. Sometimes there is self-selection of interest by the child. The child must feel valued and loved. The family background and relationship of parents centers on the child. The time, place, and institutions foster the development of interest and value of the work and the child's belief in its value. The child is allowed freedom of development, without undue inhibition or restriction. Creative people have shown uneven development--the child is not ""age-specific"" generally. Gifted children have been observed to tolerate isolation and even loneliness well--these are often necessary conditions for developing skills. For some creative people, early object losses seem to be frequent. The creative child is curious and a keen observer. The creative child has an uncanny ability to make connections--to perceive similarities in the apparently dissimilar. The creative child is not hampered by conventional thought. The creative child has a capacity for love and devotion--or at least a positive orientation; a spiritness or passion; and a spirituality or unworldliness. It has been said that the poetic truths in a work of art are only half understood by its creator. Generally conveyed subliminally, these truths are revealed in different ways to different audiences at different times. Such is the view of William Livingstone (1987), and considering the childhood antecedents of creative work helps to understand why this is so.",pubmed,0.9999999999999999
914,1372,Gifted adolescents: An analysis of their psychosocial development.,,,Journal of youth and adolescence,10.1007/BF02092110,,"A model for viewing adolescent psychosocial development is outlined. The model assumes that basic changes in adolescents' biological, cognitive, and social capacities reciprocally interact with the social settings of the family, peer group, and school/work to influence transformations in six areas of psychosocial development (attachment, friendship, sexuality, achievement, autonomy, and identity). The model is then used as a framework for reviewing literature regarding gifted adolescents' psychosocial adjustment. On the whole, the literature provides a positive view of the psychosocial adjustment of gifted adolescents. While adjustment problems seem to exist in certain areas (e.g., friendship), unequivocal conclusions cannot be drawn because of methodological limitations and the narrow scope of existing research.

4125,4583,"Childhood celebrity, parental attachment, and adult adjustment: the young performers study.",,,Journal of personality assessment,,,"The associations between celebrity, parental attachment, and adult adjustment were examined among 74 famous, former young performers in television and film. As adults, former young performers whose parents served as their professional managers viewed their mothers as less caring and more overcontrolling than did performers whose parents were not their managers. Other factors affecting the quality of the parent-child relationship included dissatisfaction with money management, poor peer support, the perception that involvement in acting was determined by others, and the specific nature of professional experience. Together, these variables accounted for 59% of the variance in perceived caring and 40% of the variance in perceived autonomy support. The relation could not be attributed to a generalized response bias, as attachment was unrelated to degree of positive thinking. A Celebrity x Parental Attachment interaction indicated that the quality of the parent-child relationship moderated the effects of celebrity on adult adjustment: Among participants with good parental attachment, there was no relation between professional experience and adjustment; however, among participants with poor attachment, this relation was strong. Possible implications for parenting child actors and analogous populations of talented children in high-stress arenas are discussed.",pubmed,0.9304310229018068
2422,2880,Imaginary companions in adolescence: sign of a deficient or positive development.,,,Journal of adolescence,,,"The present study was designed to find out to what extent imaginary companions are created in the diaries of adolescents. A total of 241 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years were investigated to determine the incidence as well as the characteristics and functions of such fictitious individuals in this age group. Content analysis of data obtained from questionnaires revealed that the imaginary companion was similar to the writer in many aspects. The imaginary companion supported the adolescent during the process of developing his/her identity. The relative influence of self-concept, creativity, role-taking ability, coping behavior, and egocentrism was then investigated using a hierarchical regression model. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) the deficit hypothesis, i.e. only adolescents with a deficit in social interaction create an imaginary companion, (2) the giftedness hypothesis, i.e. especially creative adolescents invent such a companion and (3) the egocentrism hypothesis, i.e. the construction of an imaginary companion is the result of perceived uniqueness and related to personal fable and imaginary audience behaviour. The results showed that the imaginary companion was not the result of an egocentric orientation, and by no means was a substitute for other trustworthy partners such as family members or friends. On the contrary, socially competent and creative adolescents with good coping abilities were particularly prone to create such a ""very special friend"".",pubmed,0.8978001344532199

704,1162,The human mind: building bridges between neuroscience and psychiatry.,,,Psychiatry,,,"This essay proposes the existence of four unique behavioral characteristics that distinguish Homo sapiens from its nearest evolutionary kin, the great apes. These are inventiveness, capacity for language, curiosity, and self-reflection or self-analysis. Some would counterargue that none of these features are ""unique"" to humans. Examples would be given of animal ""intelligence"" involving at times surprising problem-solving abilities. Even ""conversations"" between humans and parrots might be cited. However, this is to misunderstand what the focus is in the article. This is not a thesis on the continuity or discontinuities of evolution. Every well-trained biologist learns about evolution and understands that the most complex human traits have some hint of related traits in nearest relatives. Rather, the emphasis of this article has been to select and emphasize certain distinctive aspects of human behavior that are the most important features distinguishing human ""uniqueness."" Uniqueness may be quantified by the number and complexity of processes within the four attributes presented in this article. While this may be an interesting mathematical exercise, the author would rather take it for granted that the outcome would be that humans are significantly more complex in each of the four features referred to than the great apes. For those in the mental health field, one would hope that this overview of the most highly evolved systems in human brain may provide a useful framework where creative therapeutic processes can be applied to the ultimate beneficiary, the client or patient. This article proposes that psychosis can be considered the impossibility of conflict resolution among the special neuronal assemblies that separately mediate feelings of attachment versus abandonment, security versus anxiety, calmness versus anger, fulfillment versus helplessness, and satisfaction of sexual needs. Given this model, the role of the therapist is to consider whether the client is in touch with the various equilibrium points in their current life situation or crisis. A questionnaire designed to help access information on these internal states may work better than an oral interview because it forces the client to reflect. How much conflict does the client feel in sorting out personal priorities? Does the client have any practice at resolving internal conflicts? If unpracticed, is the client likely to act out in destructive ways to self or others to resolve the pressure of internal conflicts? I am sure that we can all think of current well-publicized destructive acts in which one has to wonder precisely what model of mind the psychotherapists were using to assist the client. At a higher level, each human has the potential to be creative. Whether expressed as curiosity about the universe and nature or inventiveness, as in improving the quality of one's life or by the use of gifted language as in art and music, the therapist needs to determine how to assist the client into these kinds of self-defined fulfillments, which one hopes will reduce the other tensions of conflict resolution. There is no doubt that the journey for both the client and therapist will be challenging. Ultimately, the journey is the reward for both the client and therapist. In closing, the following quotation seems appropriate. Sydney Brenner (2002), a pioneer in molecular biology, reviewed a current book on the Science, Politics, and Ethics of the Human Genome Project (Sulston and Ferry 2002). He states, ""What I found interesting in the account is that Sulston doesn't tell us anything about the genomes he has sequenced. What did he find there that excited him? What did he learn about genes, about life, about evolution, about worlds to come? It is the play of Hamlet without Hamlet"" (p. 794).",pubmed,0.8550654580383296

3412,3870,Experiences within a borderline syndrome.,,,International journal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy,,,"This paper provides an experiential view of a borderline syndrome and its psychotherapy. In a letter to her therapist a gifted patient speaks of the symptoms and treatment of her illness. This provides the basis for studying the precipitous transference relationships in borderline patients and the urgent need in these patients for clarity and dependability from their therapists. Common fears of being ""set adrift"" by psychotherapy are contrasted to the characteristic tenacity of the patient-therapist bond. A review of the patient's life allows the reader to evaluate the clinical applicability of her insights. The letter's multiple communicative functions illustrate some of the qualities of the object relations sought by borderline personalities, and stress is placed upon the sublimatory aspect of such letters and the prognostic importance of the capacities for sublimation.",pubmed,0.8432228339565843

217,675,The princess in the tower: Zelda Fitzgerald's creative impasse.,,,Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association,,,"Gifted women often find it difficult to integrate an acceptable social image with an autonomous artistic identity. This paper explores the ambitions and conflicts of Zelda Fitzgerald, who aspired to be an artist in several fields, but whose fame is largely contingent on the role she played in the life of her husband, F. Scott Fitzgerald. Zelda's flamboyant public pose, which served as a model for many of her husband's literary characters, is interpreted as an attempt to organize a consistent identity configuration by means of constant appeals for applause from an admiring audience. But although this configuration provided some stability and cohesion for her during her twenties, it was a superficial and vulnerable structure which failed to support her serious artistic aspirations. An examination of the separation conflicts and difficulties in internalization which contributed to Zelda's dilemma leads to a consideration of the role of the father in the organization of differentiated female achievements. Although Zelda Fitzgerald's pathology was extreme, her struggles suggest useful insights into the intrapsychic and social barriers commonly confronting creative women.",pubmed,0.7717906199098659
2603,3061,[Ignatius of Loyola--gifted or mentally ill?].,,,Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie,,,"Subsequent to a severe injury and under the influence of religious reading, Loyola experienced a dramatic mental change in his spiritual values in the sense of a sublimation to an alternative knighthood. His behaviour patterns observed thereafter were determined by a totality of his attachment to God. Based on this certainty in his faith, which was free from any doubts, and on God, and with the background of fasting and praying, he had visionary and pseudo-hallucinatory experiences. As the founder of an order and head of the community of Jesuits, Ignatius of Loyola proved to be diplomatically highly talented. There is no evidence of any psychotic disease. Also, there is no probability of a personality disorder in the sense of a neurosis. The numerous unusual behaviour patterns of Ignatius cannot be interpreted as psychopathological symptoms. It is justified to call him a genius.",pubmed,0.7646171437676357

This study aimed to investigate the influence of social support on depression and the mediation and moderation mechanisms of this relationship in international students. In total, 349 international students in China responded to a questionnaire survey comprising the Social Support Rating Scale, Self-rating Depression Scale, Adult Attachment Scale, and Self-Esteem Scale. The results showed that: (1) attachment closeness had a significant direct predictive effect on depression; (2) attachment closeness played a mediating role in the relationship between social support and depression; and (3) the direct effect of social support on depression and the mediating effect of attachment and closeness are regulated by self-esteem. Therefore, interventions aimed at improving the social support, attachment closeness, and self-esteem of international students in China can be effective in reducing their depressive symptoms.</jats:p>",crossref,0.4542363510121416

With the health emergency and social isolation, parents started spending more time with their children, and they might have experienced greater distress. Attachment style is considered as an effective emotion regulation strategy in the parent–child relationship. However, few empirical studies have addressed this issue. Based on attachment theory, this study aimed to find parental attachment style as a candidate to moderate the relation between parents’ negative emotions and their perceptions of their children’s negative emotions related to COVID-19. Parents (<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>age = 42.55 ± 6.56, 88.2% female) of 838 Italian children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years participated in an online survey. Results showed that parents with a fearful attachment style had significantly higher negative emotions when facing COVID-19 than those with other attachment styles. Moreover, parents with a dismissing attachment style perceived fewer negative emotions in their children than parents with fearful and preoccupied styles. At last, higher parents’ negative emotions were associated with greater perception of children’s negative emotions only in parents classified as secure and fearful. These findings suggest that parents with dismissing and fearful attachment styles and their children may be at higher risk during the COVID-19 pandemic and they should be given long-term attention.</jats:p>",crossref,0.42513160873294314

As a complement to Bowlby’s attachment theory, activation relationship theory provides a greater understanding of the impact of fathering on child development, focusing primarily on parental stimulation of risk-taking and control during child exploration. The overarching objective of this article is to better understand the association between children’s relationship quality with both parents, via the activation to father and the attachment to mother relationships, and child externalizing behaviors in a clinical sample. Fifty two-parent families (40 boys and 10 girls) were recruited at random from a population of children receiving treatment at the perinatal and early childhood psychiatry clinic. Results with 44 children (with complete cases) showed that overactivated preschoolers displayed more externalizing behaviors than did children with either an activated or an under-activated relationship with their father. Results also showed that children with a disorganized-controlling caregiving attachment to their mother marginally presented with higher levels of externalizing behavior.</jats:p>",crossref,0.4176183553659136

In addition, we examined whether stress moderated the relationship between attachment and support needs. Two-hundred and forty-five first-time mothers, currently involved in romantic relationships, participated in study 1, in which support needs and stress were appraised over the previous month using self-reports. High levels of attachment avoidance were related to needing less support, but attachment anxiety was not associated with support needs. There was no hyperactivation or deactivation of the attachment system in response to stress. It is possible that recall bias, associated with cross-sectional methods, may have confounded the results. In study 2, we sought to replicate these hypotheses using an ambulatory method to examine the association between attachment and momentary support needs in the daily life of mothers with babies ( N = 40). Results revealed that attachment anxiety was associated with a preference for high levels of momentary support, but attachment avoidance was not related to any support needs. Stress experienced in the moment was found to moderate the relationships between attachment and support needs, with mothers high in anxiety and avoidance needing more support. </jats:p>",crossref,0.4152950439672571

Despite being a frequent occurrence, running away from home still remains one of the less addressed problems in India. Factors like lack of communication and attachment to parents, abuse, poverty and peer influence have a crucial role in shaping such behaviours. The present research study is an exploratory study to examine these factors with a sample size of 100 runaway children (50 girls, 50 boys) residing in a non-governmental organisation in NCR, Delhi. The mean age of the sample is 14.4 years. Quantitative measures like Inventory of Parents and Peer Attachment (Greenberg, 1987; Gullone &amp; Robinson, 2005 ), Emotional Regulation Questionnaire ( Gross &amp; John, 2003 ), Kind of Person Implicit Theory Scale ( Dweck, 1999 ) and Satisfaction with Life Scale-Child (Gadermann et al., 2012) were used. Findings indicate a significant role of peer attachment versus parental attachment with a clear gender disparity seen in attachment styles. The repercussions of findings are immense to the rehabilitation sector with special focus on creating models of alternative care which could harness these dynamics. How models of rehabilitation could systemically harness peer attachment and create parallel edifices of emotional regulation are other aspects this research focuses upon. The study has implications for intervention-based programmes for runaways as it can help to understand their perils and make positive changes. </jats:p>",crossref,0.4071733701782299

Two different subsamples of adolescents between 12 and 16 years old participated in the study (n = 157): 67 adopted adolescents (61.2% girls) and 90 non-adopted adolescents (56.7% girls). Partial and full mediation models were analyzed in multi-group structural equation models (using maximum likelihood estimates), allocating non-adoptive and adoptive adolescents into two different groups. Results showed that whereas acceptance/involvement of each parent predicted attachment security towards the corresponding parental figure, only the father’s coercion/imposition predicted aggressiveness, and only attachment security to the mother was a (negative) predictor of adolescent’s aggressiveness. The partial mediation model provided the most parsimonious explanation for the data, showing no differences between adopted and non-adopted subsamples and supporting a good model fit for both boys and girls in a multi-group invariance analysis. The implications of these results are discussed in light of the protective effects of care relationships in early adolescence (vs. late adolescence) as well as the differential role of parent figures.</jats:p>",crossref,0.3827753409594331

Objective: The study investigates the association between perceived primary parenting styles and attachment styles between single parent children and children living with both parents.
Methods: A correlational research study was carried out on a sample of 200 children, 100single parent children (Boys=50; Girls=50) taken from single parent families living in child protection and welfare bureau and 100 children living with both parents (Boys=50; Girls=50) enrolled in different grades taken from a private school of Lahore, through purposive sampling strategy. The study was carried out at Lahore Garrison University from September 2017 to march 2017.After obtaining permission from authorities, children were given Parental Authority Questionnaireand the Urdu version of Inventory of Parental and Peer attachment.
Results:The results showed that there was a significant negative correlation between permissive parenting styles with mother’scommunication (*p&lt;.05); authoritarian parenting style has negative correlation with parental communication, and trust(***p&lt;.001). Authoritative parenting has significant positive relationship with trust (***p&lt;.001), and communication with parents (***p&lt;.001), negative relationship between authoritative parenting with feeling alienated from parents (*p&lt;.01). The resultsof t-test also revealed that single parent children perceive their parents as authoritarian (***p&lt;.001) and had more alienated attachment with parents (***p&lt;.001), whereas children living with both parents had more trust (***p&lt;.001) and had better communication with their parents (***p&lt;.001).
Conclusion: Current research is insightful in understanding the role of parents and different parenting styles in building up strong parent child attachment.

Coherently with the assumption that the attachment relationship starts to develop during pregnancy, this systematic review aims to analyze and systematize studies focused on the association between pre-natal attachment and parent-to-infant attachment, in order to clarify the emerging results and provide useful information for clinical purposes. Nineteen studies were included. Sixteen researches identified a positive relationship between pre-natal attachment and parent-to-infant attachment, and three articles highlighted a negative association between antenatal attachment and post-partum bonding disorders. These results were found both in women and men, in normative and at-risk pregnancies, adopting different assessment approaches (i.e., self-report measures, observations, and projective measures). However, only small or moderate associations were found. Future studies are needed to further confirm these findings across different populations (e.g., male samples, non-normative samples or samples in disadvantaged conditions) and with different methodological approaches (e.g., observational measures). Moreover, studies would be needed in order to clarify mechanisms through which pre-natal attachment influences parent-to-infant attachment, as well as protective and risk factors which intervene between these two variables.</jats:p>",crossref,0.37736431721060454

The present investigation tested this hypothesis by examining how relationship satisfaction varies as a function of the attachment security of both dyad members. Secondary analyses were performed using data from two studies (Study 1: 172 couples; Study 2: 194 couples) in which heterosexual dating couples were asked to complete self-reports of their own attachment style and relationship satisfaction. To evaluate the buffering hypothesis, we fit a standard APIM using SEM and added an actor × partner interaction term to our model. Contrary to expectations, our results suggested that secure partners do not “buffer” insecurely attached individuals. Moreover, partner attachment did not explain satisfaction much above and beyond actor effects. This work addresses a gap in the literature with respect to the dynamic interplay of partner pairing, allowing scholars to better understand attachment processes in romantic relationships. </jats:p>",crossref,0.3765440147295053

Women with fibromyalgia (FM) commonly suffer from depression, pervasive fatigue, and pain. The attachment style has been hypothesized to be an important factor for understanding the experience of these symptoms. Therefore, the present cross-sectional study is aimed at investigating the effect of attachment styles in women with a diagnosis of FM on depressive symptoms and quality of life. Method. Participants were 453 Italian women with a physician’s diagnosis of FM with a mean age of 47 years (<jats:inline-formula>
                     <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1"">

                  </jats:inline-formula>). To assess attachment styles, quality of life, and depressive symptoms, women responded, respectively, to the Relationship Questionnaire, the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory II. Results. Our results showed that the incidence of depressive symptoms was elevated, with 59% of women reporting moderate to severe symptoms. Also, the statistical analyses showed that both preoccupied and avoidant/dismissing attachments were related with depression symptoms and low perception of QoL. Conclusions. Our study demonstrates that, when evaluating the impact of FM on the QoL of women, it is important to consider the complexity of the variables that are at play. Insecure attachment styles and depressive symptoms seem to increase the likelihood of the psycho-social-somatic malaise in FM women.</jats:p>",crossref,0.3552483336162173

The research was aimed to examine the opinions of primary school classroom teachers (N = 1130) employed in Croatian primary schools regarding conceptualization of musical giftedness and its impact on identification of musically gifted students. Furthermore, their opinions about the support of parents, professional team and collective as well as competencies for recognizing and further development of the child’s musical giftedness were investigated. Although most respondents assess their competencies in identifying musical giftedness, most of the surveyed teachers, especially younger ones, are willing to be additionally trained in this area. They stated that the existing curriculum should be expanded and enriched and stressed the need for more support from the expert assistants (psychologists and pedagogues). In addition to the teachers' age, their title (teacher, teacher mentor and teacher advisor) also proved to be a significant factor in the identification and development of a child's musical giftedness. Findings of research have implications for theory and practice of primary school teacher’s music education and education for work with gifted children both during their higher education and lifelong learning.

Dyadic analyses and mediation tests were performed on data from 97 Czech and Slovak long-term heterosexual couples. Attachment dimensions were measured by Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised measure (ECR-R-16), six conflict communication styles by the Romantic Partner Conflict Scale (RPCS), and dyadic adjustment by the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS). We confirmed previous findings according to which in both sexes, attachment anxiety and avoidance have a negative effect on dyadic adjustment. We also found that women’s anxiety is negatively associated with their partner’s dyadic adjustment. Our mediation tests showed that in both sexes, the association between attachment anxiety and low dyadic adjustment was partially mediated by a reactive conflict communication style. Moreover, the association between attachment avoidance and low dyadic adjustment in women was partially mediated by both the reactive and compromising communication styles. These results are discussed in the context of behavioral and emotional characteristics of both attachment insecurities and gender differences in interpersonal behavior. </jats:p>",crossref,0.34915951777261817

A sample of Christian participants ( N = 235) completed a survey which included measures of attachment to God, quest, religious doubt, and mental health. As hypothesized, attachment to God and quest significantly moderated an individual’s experience of religious doubt. Low avoidant attachment to God (i.e., a more secure attachment) was associated with a more negative relationship between cognitive religious doubt and positive mental health than high avoidant attachment. In contrast, low avoidant attachment to God also ameliorated the positive relationship between affective religious doubt and mental health problems. Low anxious attachment was associated with a stronger negative relationship between both measures of religious doubt (i.e., cognitive and affective) and positive mental health. In addition, high soft quest weakened all four of the relationships between measures of religious doubt and mental health. High hard quest ameliorated the positive relationship between both measures of religious doubt and mental health problems. These results indicate that an individual’s attachment to God and the way an individual is oriented toward religion each play a role in the mental health outcomes associated with religious doubt. </jats:p>",crossref,0.3470066436456051

Stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, limitations in holding or touching the baby, and medical complications during the NICU stay can negatively affect parental mental health. This can threaten the developing parent-infant relationship and might adversely impact child development. Music therapy in the NICU is an internationally growing field of clinical practice and research and is increasingly applied to promote relationship building between parents and babies. The two most commonly used concepts describing the early parent-infant relationship are ‘attachment’ and ‘bonding’. While frequently used interchangeably in the literature, they are actually not the same and describe distinctive processes of the early relationship formation. Thus, it is important to discuss the overlaps and differences between attachment and bonding and the implications for music therapy clinical practice and research. Whereas providing examples and possible scenarios for music therapists working on either bonding or attachment, the distinction between both concepts is relevant for many health care professionals concerned with early parenting interventions in the NICU. This will hopefully lead to a more precise use of theory, and ultimately, to a more informed clinical practice and research.</jats:p>",crossref,0.33699919444662535

        <jats:p><jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold> Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a disabling mood disorder, profoundly affecting a large number of adolescent’s quality of life. To date, no obvious treatment of choice for MDD in adolescents is available and progress in the treatment of depressed adolescents will have important public health implications. Attachment-Based Family Therapy (ABFT), as the only empirically supported family therapy model designed to treat adolescent depression, aims to repair interpersonal ruptures and rebuild an emotionally protective parent-child relationship. <jats:bold>Objective: </jats:bold>To study the effectiveness of ABFT compared with treatment as usual (TAU) delivered within child- and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to adolescents with MDD.<jats:bold>Method:</jats:bold> Sixty adolescents (86.7% girls), aged 13-18 years (M = 14.9, SD = 1.35), with MDD referred to two CAMHS were randomized to 16 weeks of ABFT or TAU. ABFT consisted of weekly therapy sessions (family/individual or both) according to the treatment manual. TAU was not monitored. Primary outcomes were assessed by blinded evaluators at baseline and post-treatment with the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Self-reported (Beck Depression Inventory-II, BDI-II) depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline, and after 4, 6, 8, 10,12, 14, and 16 weeks. Analyses were performed according to intent-to-treat principles. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> At post-treatment, clinician-rated remission rates on the HAMD (5 % in ABFT and 3.33% in TAU, p =1, OR=1.54, Fisher’s exact test) and self-reported symptoms of depression on the BDI-II did not differ significantly between groups (X2[2, N = 60] =0.06 , p = 0.97). In both treatment groups participants reported significantly reduced depressive symptoms, but the majority (63.3 %) of adolescents were still in the clinical range after 16 weeks of treatment. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> ABFT was not superior to TAU. Remission and response rates were low in both groups, suggesting none of the treatments were effective in treating MDD in adolescents. Findings must be viewed in the context of the study’s small sample size, missing data, and implementation challenges. Continued efforts to improve treatment for MDD in outpatient clinics are warranted . Future research should examine moderators of and mechanisms for individual differences to treatment response, as well as the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of implementing treatment models which may require extensive training and expertise to yield clinically meaningful improvements in non-research settings. <jats:bold>Trial Registration:</jats:bold> Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01830088 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01830088?term=Villab%C3%B8&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1 Date of registration: April 12, 2013</jats:p>",crossref,0.3336337688257637

Differentiating ‘attachment difficulties’ from autism spectrum disorder (hereafter autism) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (hereafter ADHD) has been characterised as challenging. Few studies have explored how this happens in practice, from the perspective of the professionals. Design: Qualitative study. Method: We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with (n=17) healthcare professionals from five NHS Foundation Trusts in the United Kingdom. Participants were recruited using a combination of snowballing, convenience and purposive sampling. Data were analysed using a thematic approach. Results: We identified six interrelated themes that might reflect difficulties with differential conceptualisation. These include: a clinical lexicon of attachment; approaching attachment with caution; contextual factors; perceived characteristic behaviours; assessing attachment and adjacent supports; spotlighting intervention and dual conceptualisation. Conclusion: Our results indicate some of the ways suspicions around attachment are raised in practice. We advocate for more dialogue between research and practice communities on issues of differential conceptualisation. We call for collaboration between a panel of experts consisting of attachment and neurodevelopmental orientated practitioners and researchers, to clarify issues around differentiating between attachment difficulties, ASD and ADHD.</p>",crossref,0.3325891908482704

                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Being gifted with a very high IQ (&gt; 98 percentile) can provide an advantage in the occupational context but can also come with its` own specific challenges. Where some studies found higher than average levels of wellbeing at work and successful careers amongst the gifted, other studies report boredom and less job satisfaction. This poses the question what gifted people value in work, and which factors are associated with the achievement of valued work related outcomes, wellbeing and sustainable employability. In this study these questions were explored using the value driven capability approach as a theoretical framework.</jats:p>

                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Participants placed great value on the opportunity to learn, to use their knowledge and skills, and tended to have high ethical standards. If realized, these values contributed to wellbeing whereas if not fulfilled, this often resulted in frustration and sadness. The most important personal factors associated with wellbeing at work and sustainable employability were the level of organizational awareness, self-knowledge, a willingness to compromise, and fear of stigmatisation. Contextually a facilitating leadership style of managers was important, allowing the worker autonomy and decision latitude. Socially, participants enjoyed others as sparring partners but often had an aversion to small talk which could lead to social avoidance and loneliness.</jats:p>

                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
                <jats:p>If gifted workers managed (to get) what they valued in work, this was associated with wellbeing and sustainable employment Coaching aimed at improving organizational awareness, specific social skills (e.g. small talk, adaptability) and understanding their own cognitive processes could be valuable. The application of an autonomy supporting facilitative leadership style by supervisors would be beneficial. Further research should try to confirm the findings using quantitative methods and needs to examine more closely the impact of stigmatisation and leadership styles.</jats:p>

                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
                <jats:p>The relationship between parent–child attachment and executive function (EF) in middle childhood remains relatively poorly studied. Very little is known about the role that the child’s verbal ability might play in these relationships. Therefore, in the present study, we explored the concurrent links between perceived attachment security with parents and hot and cool inhibitory control (IC)—a core component of EF—as well as the potential mediating role of verbal ability in those links.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
                <jats:p>The participants were 160 children aged 8 to 12 (51% girls). They completed the Attachment Security Scale, the computerised version of the go/no-go task, the delay discounting task, and the vocabulary subtest from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Pearson’s correlations were conducted to test relationships between the study variables. A hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine whether attachment security uniquely contributed to the outcomes after accounting for covariates. The indirect effects were tested using a non-parametric resampling bootstrap approach.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                <jats:p>The results showed that, after accounting for the child’s age and sex, there was a direct relationship between attachment security with the father and cool, but not hot, IC. However, there were no significant links between attachment security with the mother and both aspects of IC. We also found that children’s verbal ability played a mediating role in the associations between both child–father and child–mother attachment security and hot, but not cool, IC above and beyond the child’s age.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
                <jats:p>The current study extends previous work on executive functions in middle childhood. The results highlight the role of attachment in explaining individual differences in IC in middle childhood as well as the different mechanisms through which attachment with parents might explain cool vs. hot IC. The findings have potential implications for therapeutic interventions using the family context as a target to improve IC in middle childhood.</jats:p>

19,282,Turning Points in the Assessment and Clinical Applications of Individual Differences in Attachment,,,,10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0271,"{'given': 'Patricia', 'family': 'Crittenden', 'sequence': 'first', 'affiliation': []}","<p>Attachment may have reached a turning point in which two sometimes incompatible approaches to individual differences in attachment are being compared. The outcome could influence future work in attachment. This article focuses on individual differences because applications of attachment are predicated on the consequences of individual differences for adaptation and well-being. The issue is which model is better suited to future research and clinical applications. Both models augment the original Ainsworth ABC model that everyone agrees is not sufficiently differentiated to cover the range of human behavior. The two models are “ABC+D” (the model that has disorganization (D) as its fourth category) and “DMM” (the model that expands the A and C categories from two subcategories each to a total of eight each, plus A/C combinations). The current disagreement has two sources: (a) the increasing acceptance outside the United States of the DMM, particularly in clinical and forensic settings, while the US remains largely unaware of the DMM; and (b) the recent announcement by prominent ABC+D researchers from Europe and the US that D is not a suitable category for clinical or forensic use. ABC+D researchers have not proposed an alternative, and some US funding sources and courts eschew attachment altogether, believing the theory itself lacks validity and utility, thus weakening attachment’s potential to inform clinical research and decision-making. This article proposes DMM as a viable alternative to both ABC+D and psychiatric diagnoses and examines the development and contributions of each model for the purpose of creating a model of individual differences in attachment that is scientifically robust, open to change as new evidence becomes available, and applicable to troubled individuals and families. Notably, attachment theory has engendered controversy from its beginnings. When John Bowlby offered attachment as a universal human characteristic that promoted species and individual survival, he was criticized by others in his field. When Mary Ainsworth identified the ABC categories of individual differences in attachment, her ideas were attacked from outside attachment theory. While the “first generation” issue around the existence of attachment has largely died away, a second generation of attachment theorists is disputing the nature of individual differences, their focus on individuals (ABC+D) or interpersonal systems (DMM Family Functional Formulations), and their relevance to clinical work. The ABC+D and DMM models that expand Ainsworth’s work were developed by two of her students, Mary Main (ABC+D) and Patricia Crittenden (DMM). They and their colleagues have worked separately for half a century producing two large and sometimes discrepant bodies of work, which have now become the topic of open debate. This bibliography focuses on the conceptual and empirical bases for that exchange. Part I outlines the roots of the ABC+D and DMM models, together with comparative validating information. Part II presents the central research findings on individual differences in attachment from four decades of research with each model. The authors wish to thank Robbie Duschinsky, Udita Iyengar, and Andrea Landini for their helpful comments on this bibliography.</p>",crossref,0.3206355109350391

These psychological foundations remain a strong influence even though the field has since expanded to include other paradigms and greater diversity in conceptions of giftedness and talent. Some researchers argue that the field could benefit from greater interdisciplinary engagement, especially in studies of gifted and talented girls, which tend to include a focus on how gifted girls’ external environments influence their emotional worlds. This article proposes that concepts developed by critical sociologist Pierre Bourdieu are useful for expanding and deepening understandings of the internal and external worlds of gifted and talented girls. It offers evidence from a recent qualitative study with academically gifted and talented teenaged girls in New Zealand. The results highlighted the marginalised position of the gifted and talented identity and the privileging of identities that were based on dispositions versus innate ability. The study also identified a hierarchy of valued forms of capital within the teenage girl social landscape and a resulting theorisation of an empowered gifted and talented girl habitus. This article demonstrates how Bourdieu’s work is a constructive addition to the field.</jats:p>",crossref,0.3163340765053798

                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a disabling mood disorder, profoundly affecting a large number of adolescent’s quality of life. To date, no obvious treatment of choice for MDD in adolescents is available and progress in the treatment of depressed adolescents will have important public health implications. Attachment-Based Family Therapy (ABFT), as the only empirically supported family therapy model designed to treat adolescent depression, aims to repair interpersonal ruptures and rebuild an emotionally protective parent–child relationship.</jats:p>

                <jats:title>Objective</jats:title>
                <jats:p>To study the effectiveness of ABFT compared with treatment as usual (TAU) delivered within child- and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to adolescents with MDD.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Method</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Sixty adolescents (86.7% girls), aged 13–18 years (M = 14.9, SD = 1.35), with MDD referred to two CAMHS were randomized to 16 weeks of ABFT or TAU. ABFT consisted of weekly therapy sessions (family/individual or both) according to the treatment manual. TAU was not monitored. Primary outcomes were assessed by blinded evaluators at baseline and post-treatment with the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Self-reported (Beck Depression Inventory-II, BDI-II) depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline, and after 4, 6, 8, 10,12, 14, and 16 weeks. Analyses were performed according to intent-to-treat principles.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                <jats:p>At post-treatment, clinician-rated remission rates on the HAMD (5% in ABFT and 3.33% in TAU, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 1, OR = 1.54, Fisher’s exact test) and self-reported symptoms of depression on the BDI-II did not differ significantly between groups (<jats:italic>X</jats:italic><jats:sup><jats:italic>2</jats:italic></jats:sup>[2, <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 60] = 0.06, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.97). In both treatment groups participants reported significantly reduced depressive symptoms, but the majority (63.3%) of adolescents were still in the clinical range after 16 weeks of treatment.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
                <jats:p>ABFT was not superior to TAU. Remission and response rates were low in both groups, suggesting none of the treatments were effective in treating MDD in adolescents. Findings must be viewed in the context of the study’s small sample size, missing data, and implementation challenges. Continued efforts to improve treatment for MDD in outpatient clinics are warranted. Future research should examine moderators of and mechanisms for individual differences to treatment response, as well as the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of implementing treatment models which may require extensive training and expertise to yield clinically meaningful improvements in non-research settings.</jats:p>

Strategies for addressing this challenge have been to use universal screening and local norms; however, these useful recommendations continue to focus on traditional testing procedures that measure what students already know and overlook other important traits that contribute to high levels of creative productivity. Assessment for learning examines traits such as interests, instructional preference styles, preferred modes of expression, and executive function skills. Although sometimes referred as the “soft skills,” they have gained much more attention on the parts of college admission officers and employers, especially for higher level leadership positions. Instruments that assess these traits are often completed by the students themselves; and technology and artificial intelligence now allow us to administer and analyze them with the same ease used for traditional standardized tests. </jats:p>",crossref,0.31242858111953375

This is surprising for two reasons: first, there are a number of parallels between the behaviors of children with an insecure and disorganized attachment and the behaviors of children with an ADHD diagnosis. Second, secure attachment has a positive effect on the development of skills in areas in which children with ADHD demonstrate problems (e.g., attention span, impulse control). There are currently no findings on whether or not and how insecure and disorganized attachment and ADHD affect children’s emotion recognition ability. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, part exploratory and part hypothesis-driven in the context of basic research. A clinical sample of 5- to 10-year-old children with an ADHD diagnosis and their parents is to be compared to a non-clinical unaffected control group. Over a period of 3 years, 80 subjects and their parents are to be recruited in each group for participation in the study. Discussion: This study is the first to examine links between attachment, emotion recognition ability, and ADHD. It is also the first to include not just children with ADHD but also their mothers and fathers in its design. The findings should help reduce the research gap and generate more knowledge for family interventions in the case of ADHD.</jats:p>",crossref,0.3123588277550616

Currently, it is thought that generalizing patterns algebraically can serve to provide challenges and opportunities that match their potential. This article focuses on a mathematically gifted student’s use of generalization strategies to identify linear and nonlinear patterns in the context of a matchstick problem. Data were collected from a 10th-grade gifted student’s problem-solving process in a qualitative research design. It was observed that the gifted student’s ways of generalizing the linear and nonlinear patterns were different. In a generalization process, the student used figural reasoning in the linear pattern and numerical reasoning in the nonlinear patterns. It was noted that the student explored using Gauss’s approach in structuring the general rules of nonlinear patterns. Accordingly, aside from assisting their more gifted students, mathematics teachers may want to consider ways to introduce Gaussian thinking to the benefit of all their students. </jats:p>",crossref,0.308587212624163

Tourists, especially fans are no longer satisfied with the traditional tourist attractions with special symbolic meanings when visiting South Korea, but instead focus on common places associated with idols. For example, restaurants, cafes, bookstores, parks and convenience stores that have appeared in an idol’s social network accounts. With the application of the theory of attachment and sense of place in the tourism field, this study will start from the celebrity attachment, to exploring the specific processes and mechanisms by which idols affect the behavioral intentions of the fans. The associations between visitors and idol-related places based on celebrity attachments has also become possible, and the fans/tourists’ opinions and attitudes toward idol-related places will also change due to this emotional attachment. Relevant data were collected in the form of online questionnaires, and 440 valid responses were finalized for data analysis. Through data analysis, all the hypotheses proposed in this paper are supported, and there are significant relationships and positive influences among the variables. Data analysis results show that idol attachment can positively influence the four cognitive dimensions of sense of place (place identity, place dependence, social bonding and atmosphere). The various dimensions of sense of place can promote the generation of place attachment.</jats:p>",crossref,0.29772485779955604

This study used a qualitative method with a descriptive analysis approach without using statistical formulas or formulas or SPSS assistance. The data in this study were obtained from the analysis of conversation or dialogue as well as the development of the Early Dini Suryani language of the third-grade students of SDN 27 / III Lolo Kecil with their peers, interacting in class with the teacher and while in the family environment. Researchers found that early language development was different from normal children who tended to have the use of well-ordered and well-structured language. Dini also uses a variety of vocabulary that is appropriate for certain contexts. The use of intonation and facial expression in interacting was also applied by Dini in communicating. Even so, Dini has a mental disorder that is high egoistic like when she wants everything she will do even though she forces her will. To maximize early abilities character education is the right support step or method. Thus, Dini can be a gifted child with a good personality.</jats:p>",crossref,0.2945111551238606

This study aimed to investigate associations between attachment security to mothers, fathers, closest grandparents and peers, and young adolescents’ (a) prosocial responses to others’ distress and (b) global prosocial behaviors, via the mediation of empathic concern. Cross-sectional survey data were obtained from 520 adolescents (aged 11–14) from nine schools in Cape Town, South Africa. Structural equation modeling revealed that a model in which all paths from the attachment variables were routed through empathic concern was superior to a model which proposed only direct effects of attachment on prosocial behavior. Peer and grandparent attachment were significantly associated, through empathic concern, with self-reported helping in response to others’ distress. For teacher-reported global prosocial behavior, the indirect effects of peer and grandparent attachment failed to reach significance. The results provide theoretical insight into the association between secure attachments and prosocial behavior, and highlight the importance of relationships with friends and grandparents in early adolescence. </jats:p>",crossref,0.2787688552787517

For this purpose, 15 former Olympians were engaged in interviews about how they developed their mathematical talent at university, how they selected their careers, and how they developed their mathematical talent within their careers. Thematic analysis was undertaken on the collected data. The resulting themes provided useful insights into the reasoning behind the selection of one’s area of study, the nature of the study experience, the factors considered in the career decision, and the nature of mathematical development in one’s career. Among other conclusions, the study suggested the applicability of two theories (i.e., the theory of work adjustment and the megamodel of talent development) in understanding the educational/career decisions of this group, the need for more systematic gifted education provisions within tertiary settings, and a prominent “brain drain” effect. </jats:p>",crossref,0.2626302495516077

                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Attachment theory demonstrates that early attachment experience shapes internal working models with mental representations of self and close relationships, which affects personality traits and interpersonal relationships in adulthood. Although research has focused on brain structural and functional underpinnings to disentangle attachment styles in healthy individuals, little is known about the spontaneous brain activity associated with self-reported attachment anxiety and avoidance during the resting state.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
                <jats:p>One hundred and nineteen individuals participated in the study, completing the Experience in Close Relationship scale immediately after an 8-min fMRI scanning. We used the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signal of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and resting-state functional connectivity to identify attachment-related regions and networks.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Consequently, attachment anxiety is closely associated with the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the right posterior cingulate cortex, over-estimating emotional intensity and exaggerating outcomes. Moreover, the functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and fusiform gyrus increases detection ability for potential threat or separation information, facilitating behavior motivation. The attachment avoidance is positively correlated with the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation in the bilateral lingual gyrus and right postcentral and negatively correlated with the bilateral orbital frontal cortex and inferior temporal gyrus. Functional connection with attachment avoidance contains critical nodes in the medial temporal lobe memory system, frontal-parietal network, social cognition, and default mode network necessary to deactivate the attachment system and inhibit attachment-related behavior.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Conclusion and implications</jats:title>
                <jats:p>These findings clarify the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and resting-state functional connectivity neural signature of attachment style, associated with attachment strategies in attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance individuals. These findings may improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of the attachment-related disorder.</jats:p>

Besides, the goal was to evaluate the relationship between the variables of the use of humor, the process of coping through a sense of humor, and the appreciating humor in cases of ignoring and avoiding during social exclusion. A relational screening model was used in the research. Among the research variables included in the model, social exclusion (ostracism) is considered as a dependent variable, while the sense of humor is an independent variable. The study group is composed of 202 students who are diagnosed as gifted and talented students. Within the scope of the study, the “Multidimensional Sense of Humor Scale for Children” developed by Akın and Bilgin (2015) and the “Social Exclusion Scale for Adolescents” developed by Sertelin Mercan (2016) have been applied. When the data collected as a result of the study was examined, it was revealed that there was a positive relationship between the sub-dimensions of generating a sense of humor, coping through humor, and appreciating humor, which is the sense of humor sub-dimensions of gifted and talented students and the exclusion subdimension of social exclusion. This situation shows that gifted and talented children generate a sense of humor, cope with this situation through humor, and appreciate humor when they face exclusion in their social environment.</jats:p>",crossref,0.2504066106197367

Although research has revealed various negative consequences of overparenting among offspring, very few studies have looked at the attachment features of overparented emerging adults. Relying on cross-sectional data collected from 231 emerging adults ( M age = 24.22 years, 57.1% females) recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), the present study examined the associations between overparenting and emerging adults’ insecure attachment (i.e., attachment anxiety and/or avoidance) in parent-offspring and romantic contexts, and if overparented emerging adults delay marriages. Results showed that overparenting was robustly associated with emerging adults’ insecure attachment with both parents and romantic partners, and overparented emerging adults were less likely to be married. Overall, the findings suggest that overparenting practices, although seemingly well-intentioned, might indeed create barriers for emerging adults to develop and maintain positive and healthy relationships. </jats:p>",crossref,0.2308066445924701

In this meta-analytic evaluation, we aimed to investigate (a) the generalizability of validity evidence of NNAT by checking its construct and criterion validity with other measures (Part I) and (b) whether NNAT truly meets its goal to identify more culturally diverse students (Part II). After reviewing 1,714 studies, a total of 29 studies met our criteria (59 effect sizes from 22 studies for Part I and 7 effect sizes from 7 studies for Part II). In Part I, we investigated empirical evidence of validity of NNAT in relationship with different types of measures (overall effect size of r was .44); The results revealed that the correlation between NNAT and the achievement test results was 0.68, followed by the intelligence measures similar to NNAT (e.g., Cognitive Abilities Test, Otis–Lennon School Ability Tests; r = .31) and other alternative measures often used to identify gifted students (e.g., teacher-rating scale; r = .20). The moderator analysis results showed high correlations between NNAT and other measures when Naglieri is an author of the study. In Part II, although NNAT identified more students of color compared with other nonverbal tests (overall effect size of risk ratio was 0.42), findings revealed that students of color remain underrepresented in gifted programs and services. </jats:p>",crossref,0.23018864453796614

This phenomenon has been well-documented in response to several natural and man-made disasters, but its global scope and severity in the context of COVID-19 are unprecedented. This response can negatively impact health, food security, and disease prevention efforts. Attempts to modify such behaviors are more likely to succeed if they are based on insights from both the biomedical and the social sciences. From a biological perspective, the phenomenological overlap between panic buying and psychological disorders such as hoarding disorder and compulsive buying raises the possibility of a shared neurobiological underpinning. Evolutionary models suggest that these behaviors represent an attempt to enhance individual and group survival in the face of a threatened scarcity of resources. These phenomena may be influenced by specific genetic variants which are also implicated in hoarding-related psychological disorders. From a psychological perspective, attachment theory provides a conceptual framework that serves as a bridge between prior life adversity, current deprivation, and an increased attachment to material objects. Such a framework is of relevance when considering panic buying during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been associated with significant disruptions in attachment bonds. From a social-anthropological perspective, hoarding and related behaviors have been associated with social exclusion and rejection, as well a lack of social support. These risk factors have affected large sections of the general population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental responses to it. This perspective also emphasizes the symbolic significance of the hoarded objects themselves. In this paper, an attempt is made to integrate these three perspectives and thereby formulate a biopsychosocial model of panic buying in response to this global health crisis. The existing scientific literature on panic buying is examined in the light of this model. Finally, suggestions are proposed as to how this model might inform social strategies aimed at preventing or reducing panic buying.</jats:p>",crossref,0.22881735696536482

Extending this theory to human-animal interactions provides insights into how human psychology affects pets, such as pet obesity. The goal of this study was to determine how attachment anxiety and avoidance might contribute to pet obesity. We assessed 563 pet owners’ attachment-related anxiety and avoidance, as well as additional attachment-related constructs (emotional rejection, evaluation concern, caregiving, and attentiveness to a pet). We also assessed various factors associated with pet obesity, including weight, body condition, daily treats, and daily interaction. The results indicate that dog owners high in attachment anxiety are concerned about how their pet may evaluate them, leading to more caregiving and attentiveness that results in more treats given per day, and a larger body condition (but not weight). In addition, owners high in attachment avoidance may seek to downplay the possibility of the dog negatively evaluating them, thus providing more negligent care. These findings suggest that attachment plays a unique role in shaping the pet-caregiver relationship and influences various elements that contribute to pet obesity, particularly in dogs. As such, the findings may lend a novel perspective to strategies for reducing pet obesity and provide a framework for future research into pet health.</jats:p>",crossref,0.21477229427414637

One of these high-risk behaviors is mobile phone addiction that is a sociopsychological phenomenon, and the lack of control in the use of this technology by students can cause damage to various aspects of their personal and educational lives. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mediating role of procrastination in the relationship between positive and negative perfectionism and addiction to mobile phone in gifted students.&#x0D;
Method: This was a descriptive and correlational study in which 200 gifted students from gifted students’ high school of Meshghinshahr were selected using cluster sampling in 2020. Tri-Shot Perfectionism questionnaires, Tuckman Procrastination Scale, and Savari Mobile Phone Addiction questionnaire were applied to collect data. Descriptive statistics, correlation matrix, and path analysis (Structural Model) were used to analyze data.&#x0D;
Results: The findings revealed positive and negative perfectionism was not directly related to cell phone addiction. However, positive perfectionism through procrastination meditation had a negative and indirect relationship with mobile phone addiction (β = -0.18), and negative perfectionism through procrastination meditation had a positive and indirect relationship with mobile phone addiction (β = 0.17). In other words, procrastination is a complete mediation in the relationship between negative and positive perfectionism and cell phone addiction in students (β = 0.29).&#x0D;
Conclusion: The results emphasized the effect of procrastination on the relationship between positive and negative perfectionism and mobile phone addiction in gifted students. Therefore, these findings can help school and rehabilitation counselors to prepare programs for reducing students' addictive and avoidant behaviors.</jats:p>",crossref,0.2139581814005787

Seventy teachers completed the HOPE Scale on 1,467 students in grades K-5 and four ESL teachers completed the scale on 131 ELs. Measurement invariance tests indicated that the HOPE Scale yields noninvariant latent means across EL and English proficient (EP) samples. However, confirmatory factor analysis results support the use of the scale with ELs or EP students separately. Results also indicate that the rating patterns of classroom and ESL teachers were different and that the HOPE Scale does not yield valid data when used by ESL teachers. Caution is recommended when using the HOPE Scale and other teacher rating scales to compare ELs to EP students. The importance of invariance testing before using an instrument with a population that is different from the one(s) for which the instrument was developed is discussed. </jats:p>",crossref,0.1932929361011293

Meanwhile, Singaporean students have been among the top achievers in all these competitions. Many comparative studies have been done between different nations and Singapore, but in few, if any, of these studies the focus has been on comparisons regarding gifted education. Singaporean policies and practices on gifted education generally prioritise a commitment to engaging learners from all ability levels with appropriately challenging curricula and instruction. In this article we report on a comparative study between the Singaporean and South African education systems. Three frames, (a) political context (b) curriculum structure and (c) loose coupling shaped the analysis. Results show that both countries had similar challenges at the point of independence from colonial rule and yet, they responded differently to those challenges. Singapore implemented inclusive education driven by excellence while South Africa’s inclusive education is driven by equity without excellence. South Africa has a one-size-fits-all curriculum, whereas Singapore has alternatives that create multiple pathways for learners to reach their full potential. Although gifted education is being proposed in current South African pronouncements, there is no evidence of coherence in terms of its implementation. Meanwhile, Singapore has a coherent system that ensures their policies move from theory into practice. All these are lessons that South Africa can learn.</jats:p>",crossref,0.18934018034801484

According to moral core researchers, infants are born with a moral sense that allows them to care about and evaluate the actions of third parties. In attachment theory, care manifests through infants' relationships with caregivers, which forms representations called internal working models that shape how babies think, feel, and act. Although accumulating evidence supports the existence of a moral core directed toward others, nevertheless, without a notion of care connected to infants' own lives, the core is an incomplete and underpowered construct. We show how the moral core, like attachment, could emerge in first- and second-person working models that develop through social interaction and incorporate representational forms (embodied, social, cognitive, emotional, moral), which contribute to the emergence of third-person representations and give infants' moral sense its vitality and meaning. </jats:p>",crossref,0.18462823308490114

We analyzed publicly available district gifted program plans (Grades 3-5) from two states to examine the extent to which district identification practices matched intervention strategies. Our team developed a coding scheme matrix with 133 items for State 1 ( n = 115) and State 2 ( n = 178). The results of this study indicated that, at least in terms of planning, districts in the two states we examined appeared to be aligning identification and programming practices to meet the needs of gifted students identified in mathematics and/or reading/English language arts. In State 1, at least 60% of the districts reported the following intervention strategies in mathematics and reading/English language arts: faster pace of coverage, regular grade-level standards, in-depth coverage, preassessment, above grade-level standards, and expanded grade-level standards. In contrast, State 2 districts reported faster pace of coverage; however, with less commonly utilized interventions, subject-matter identification significantly influenced their usage. Differentiation was the primary learning environment strategy utilized by districts in both states. </jats:p>",crossref,0.17873733781243722

This is presented with relevant real-world examples and #BlackVoices through youth poetry. The framework of critical race theory is used as a lens, to situate the world in which Black joy is found. The author argues that this manifestation, situated within the structural racism ever present in the system of education, has the unfortunate impact of igniting educators’ anti-blackness, resulting in the missingness (Gentry et al., 2019) of gifted Black students from gifted programs and services. The author delves into constructs of white supremacy, white rage, and antiblackness as the foundational concepts that contribute to this missingness, using research and more youth poetry to substantiate the claims. #BlackVoices are featured throughout, as emic perspectives, giving voice, heart, soul, and joy to the research, the words on the page.</p>",crossref,0.13722307020608993

The  author  points  out  the  need  for  pedagogical  support of the adaptation of gifted students. Based on modern research in the field of philosophy, sociology, psychology, and semiosociopsychology, the author formulates the basic principles of adaptation in a multicultural society of an educational institution.Sustainable development of society and security of the country can be ensured by the formation of national identity in all members of society, which means unity of aspirations, coherence, and peaceful coexistence in the perspectives. This is especially true for Ukraine, which today not only strives for sustainable development but also is forced to defend its independence and integrity. In the conditions of modern civilization development, it is a question of formation in the person of so-called multilevel identity which, on the one hand, means belonging to a certain ethnic group that provides the person full disclosure of its abilities, and on the other – guarantees formation of the feeling of belonging to the wider community – the nation (multinational entity, united by a common historical destiny and the idea of security and development of their own state).Self-identification of the individual (or the formation of a multi-tiered identity) is important because it is the key to its successful self-realization. It is closely linked to deep mental formations, the leading one being ethnic identity. This is especially true for the gifted person because talents can develop and fully ensure the self-realization of the individual, provided it is successfully adopted in society. The success of the adaptation of a gifted person in a multicultural society can be ensured under the condition of purposeful pedagogical support, the principles of organization of which are formulated in the article. It is noted that to reveal the giftedness of a person, his intellectual development should take into account the formation of the semiosphere related to ethnicity, and the formation of national identity should be based on the formation of a common semiosphere of all participants in the educational process.Key words: national identity, ethnicity, semiospace, self-identification, self-realization, education.              Статтю присвячено актуальній проблемі адаптації обдарованих дітей в освітньому просторі сучас-ної школи з урахуванням полікультурного середовища, що утворюється контингентом учнів різних етносів і культур. Автор вказує на необхідність педагогічного супроводу адаптації обдарованих учнів. Спираючись на сучасні дослідження в області філософії, соціології, психології і семіосоціопсихології, автор формулює основні принципи організації адаптації в полікультурному соціумі освітнього закладу.Сталий розвиток суспільства й безпека країни можуть бути забезпеченими за умови формування національної ідентичності у всіх представників соціуму країни, що означає єдність прагнень, узгодженість дій та мирне співіснування в майбутньому. Особливо це актуально для України, яка нині не лише прагне до сталого розвитку, а й змушена відстоювати свою незалежність і цілісність. В умовах сучасного цивілізаційного розвитку йдеться про формування в особистості так званої багатоярусної ідентичності, яка, з одного боку, означає приналежність до певної етнічної групи, що забезпечує особистості повне розкриття її здібностей, а з другого – гарантує формування відчуття приналежності до більш широкої спільноти – нації (багатонаціонального утворення, що об’єднане спільністю історичної долі та ідеєю безпеки й розвитку власної держави).Самоідентифікація особистості (або формування багатоярусної ідентичності) є важливою, оскільки є запорукою її успішної самореалізації. Вона тісно пов’язана з глибокими ментальними утвореннями, провідною з яких є етнічна ідентичність. Особливо це актуально для обдарованої особистості, оскільки обдарування можуть розвинутися й повною мірою забезпечити самореалізацію особистості за умови її успішної адаптації в соціумі. Успішність адаптації обдарованої особистості в полікультурному соціумі може бути забезпечено за умови цілеспрямованого педагогічного супроводу, принципи організації яко-го й сформульовано у статті. Зазначено, що для розкриття обдарованості особистості має відбуватися її інтелектуальний розвиток з урахуванням формування семіосфери, пов’язаної з етнічною приналежністю, а формування національної ідентичності має відбуватися на основі формування спільної семіосфери усіх учасників освітнього процесу на основі опанування семіосфери державної мови, спільної для всіх учасників освітнього процесу.Ключові слова: національна ідентичність, етнічність, семіопростір, самоідентифікація, само-реалізація, освіта.</jats:p>",crossref,0.128945129499002

The present study builds on brand signalling and attachment theory to investigate whether credible place brands affect consumers’ attachment formation, their subsequent word of mouth (WOM) and intention to return. Survey data from an Alpine winter sport destination reveal that place brand credibility is a key antecedent of consumers’ attachment. Moreover, consistent with brand signalling theory, credible place brands exert a particularly strong direct effect on consumers’ WOM. A positive effect on their intention to return, however, will result only if they feel attached with the place brand beforehand.
