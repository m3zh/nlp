683,1629,Factors Associated with a Delayed Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis in Children Previously Assessed on Suspicion of Autism.,2021-01-03 00:00:00,,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,10.1007/s10803-020-04849-x,,"This study aimed to investigate factors associated with a delayed autism spectrum (ASD) diagnosis when compared to children with either no or early ASD diagnosis. Among 893 children assessed for ASD before age 8, 39% had no ASD at baseline, of which 21% received a later ASD diagnosis. Autism symptoms, diagnostic history of other developmental disorders, cognitive ability, and socioeconomic factors were associated with delayed ASD. Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) scores in delayed ASD fell between early and no ASD. Other developmental disorders, time and clinical trends like ADOS use and low parental education distinguished delayed and early ASD, whereas higher frequency of IQ < 70 at baseline and a diagnosis of emotional disorders during follow-up distinguished delayed and no ASD.",pubmed,0.9999999999999999

Therapeutic interventions are most effective if applied early, yet diagnosis often remains delayed, partly because the diagnosis is based on identifying abnormal behaviors that may not emerge until the disorder is well established. Universal screening has been recommended by the America Academy of Pediatrics at 18 and 24 months yet studies show low compliance by pediatricians and the US Preventive Services Task Force does not support universal screening. To better understand the limitations of universal screening this article looks at the performance of screening tests given the prevalence of ASD. Specifically, although the sensitivity and specificity of the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-up, the de facto screening tool, exceeds 90%, the relatively low prevalence of ASD in the general population (∼2%) results in a positive predictive value of about 33%, resulting in only 1 of 3 children identified by the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-up actually having ASD. To mitigate this issue, the America Academy of Pediatrics has recently recommended the use of a Level 2 screener after failing a Level 1 screener, before referring children on for a full comprehensive evaluation for ASD. In this way, a series of screening tools are used to enrich the population of children referred for further evaluation so fewer without an ASD diagnosis are evaluated. We have developed a program to train pediatricians to utilize these instruments as well as learn to diagnose ASD so children can effectively be referred for appropriate services at the front lines. Given the current burden on the medical system with the diagnosis and evaluation of children with ASD, it is important to create efficient systems for screening children which can best identify those most likely to have ASD. Developing methods to identify those children most at risk for developing ASD, either through consideration of medical or family history or through the use of biomarkers, may be helpful in identifying the children that require increased surveillance and those that do not need screening.",pubmed,0.9578354035847207

Although most children in the United States are not diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder until preschool, at ages 3-4 years, symptoms can be reliably detected at 14 months. It is less certain how those toddlers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder earlier versus later differ from each other clinically. This study revealed that young children diagnosed later in development, between ages 25 and 41 months, are more impaired on measures of cognitive, adaptive, and social functioning than their counterparts who are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder earlier. All young children with autism spectrum disorder are impaired in communication to a similar degree, however. Universal autism screening at 18 months may identify toddlers with autism spectrum disorder when their symptoms are milder and more readily amenable to intervention. Repeated screening at 24 months is supported to detect those children missed by an earlier screening, who may be more severely affected. Caregivers should be encouraged to pursue diagnostic evaluation at an initial positive screening result to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment.",pubmed,0.935346402230851

Most of the current assessment scales have been developed in the West. The present study examines the applicability of one of the most used scales (the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised) in a Middle-Eastern culture. Two studies were undertaken. In the first, the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised ratings given to 420 children with autism spectrum disorder, aged 4-11 years, and 110 typically developing children were contrasted. In Study 2, the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised ratings of 720 children with autism spectrum disorder were compared with those of 172 children with intellectual disabilities to find out whether the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised scale would discriminate between these two types of developmental disabilities. The studies confirmed the acceptability of the scale to Iranian parents and assessors. However, the summary scores used to determine whether a child was likely to have autism spectrum disorder were recalculated on the two domains of social communication and repetitive behaviours, which were identified in the statistical analyses that are recommended for the evaluation of assessment scales. Thus the translated scale with the modified domain scoring proved very suitable for identifying Iranian children with autism spectrum disorder. Having a common tool such as Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised will strengthen the opportunities to undertake cross-cultural research into the impact of autism spectrum disorder on the child and families.",pubmed,0.9115132422700812

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis (statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple scientific studies) for studies published between 2012 and 2019 to evaluate the current age at autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. We included 56 studies that reported the age at diagnosis for 40 countries (containing 120,540 individuals with autism spectrum disorder). Results showed the current mean age at diagnosis to be 60.48 months (range: 30.90-234.57 months) and 43.18 months (range: 30.90-74.70 months) for studies that only included children aged ⩽10 years. Numerous factors that may influence age at diagnosis (e.g. type of autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, additional diagnoses and gender) were reported by 46 studies, often with conflicting or inconclusive results.

The question of whether timing of diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is associated with these consequences in adolescence has not yet been studied. This exploratory study aimed to explore the association between depression and self-harming behaviour in adolescence and the parent-reported timing of diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder using a large population-based cohort in the United Kingdom. Most of the children with autism spectrum disorder in our study had within-typical-range cognitive ability. We found a linear association between timing of autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and depression and self-harming behaviour in adolescence; later diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, particularly diagnosis in adolescence, was associated with the increased risk of self-reported depressive symptoms and self-harming behaviour in adolescence among children with autism spectrum disorder. Our findings, albeit observational, suggest that interventions targeting the earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and approaches to improve person-environment fit may help prevent secondary mental health problems in this population, particularly among those without cognitive delays and those diagnosed late.

However, disparities in the identification of ASD have been consistently documented for racial/ethnic minority and immigrant populations. The majority of studies of immigrant populations have focused on the qualitative experience of ASD, however, greater knowledge about the predictors of the age of initial ASD diagnosis is needed. This study examined the child, maternal, and family-level factors that predicted the age of initial ASD diagnosis in a diverse clinical sample through a retrospective medical record review. Medical records of clinical evaluations conducted between 2004 and 2014 were reviewed for children with ASD born to immigrant and non-immigrant mothers. Regression analyses found that for both groups of children with ASD, using verbal language to communicate and having another diagnosis (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or another condition) predicted an older age of initial ASD diagnosis. For children with ASD born to immigrant mothers, residing in a multilingual household was associated with a younger age of diagnosis. These results highlight the complexities of an ASD diagnosis among diverse children and families, particularly among immigrant communities. LAY SUMMARY: This research looked at predictors of when children received their first autism spectrum disorder diagnosis across children born to immigrant mothers and children born to U.S.-born mothers. Living in a multilingual home was related to a younger age of diagnosis for children of immigrant mothers; being verbal and having another diagnosis was related to an older age of diagnosis for both groups of children. This highlights the need to improve diagnostic services for diverse children.",pubmed,0.8755608369813485

Nevertheless, the diagnostic stability of early ASD diagnosis has not yet been fully demonstrated. This observational study examines the one-year diagnostic stability of autism spectrum disorder diagnosis in a clinical sample of 147 children diagnosed between 18 and 48 months of age. The ADOS-2 scores were used in order to stratify children in three levels of symptom severity: Autism (AD; comparison score 5-7), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD; comparison score 3-4), and Sub-Threshold Symptoms; (STS; comparison score 1-2). Results: Overall, the largest part of children and toddlers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder between 18 and 48 months continued to show autistic symptoms at one-year follow-up evaluation. Nevertheless, a significant percentage of children with higher ADOS severity scores exhibited a reduction of symptom severity and, therefore, moved towards a milder severity class one year later. Conversely, the number of subjects of the STS group meaningfully increased. Therefore, at one-year follow-up a statistically significant (χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 181.46, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) percentage of subjects (25.2% of the total) who had received a categorical diagnosis of Autistic Disorder or Autism Spectrum Disorder in baseline no longer met the criteria for a categorical diagnosis. Furthermore, children who no longer met the criteria for autism spectrum disorder continue to show delays in one or more neurodevelopmental areas, possibly related to the emergence of other neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric disorders. Overall, the comprehensive results of the study account for a high sensibility but a moderate stability of ASD early diagnosis.",pubmed,0.8571447299537273

These entail, among other things, more time at home, digital forms of communication, school closures, and reduced support and intervention. Aim: Here we aim to systematically assess the effects of the pandemic on autistic and neurotypical (NT) children, and pursue a pre-registered hypothesis suggested by initial observations that some children with autism might respond comparatively well to a situation of constrained, predictable, and digital social communication during the pandemic. Methods: We provide a systematic review of current relevant work, including 76 papers selected from a database search until February 1, 2021. We then report survey data from several countries assessing activities, well-being (PedsQLTM), and social life in families with autism, and their respective change at various stages of the pandemic. We focus on differences between children with and without autism from within the same families, and on different outcomes for children with high- or low-functioning autism. Results: While children with autism scored lower in emotional and social functioning than their NT siblings, comparable decreases in well-being and increases in anxiety were seen for both groups, compared to before the pandemic. By contrast, decreases in adaptability were significantly more pronounced in autistic than NT children. Preliminary results suggest that changes were comparable for children with high- and low-functional autism overall, but individual differences prevail. Conclusions: Overall, although individual families do report some positive effects of pandemic restrictions, our data give no clear evidence that these generalize across children with autism, or even just to children with high-functioning autism. We discuss significant challenges for children with and without autism that need to be addressed to protect childrens’ well-being under pandemic conditions but also point to potential in the present situation that could be used towards social participation and success in older children and young adults with autism.</p>",crossref,0.8544759253244043

We found that children who did not have a documented clinical diagnosis of autism and were not eligible for special education services under an autism eligibility were more likely to be female, aggressive, and argumentative. They had a poorer quality of information in their records and were less likely to have had a developmental regression, sleep problems, or an autism screener or diagnostic measure in their records. These results suggest that the symptoms characteristic of autism among this group of children may have been attributed to another disorder and that clinicians may be able to recognize autism more readily in children with more functional impairment and those who experience a developmental regression.

Children with ASD (<i>n</i> = 398; 337 boys, 61 girls) were recruited and ASD severity evaluated using the Autism Behavior Checklist and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, while the GMDS was used to evaluate the children's mental development. Study participants were divided into groups according to GMDS general and subscale quotients, ASD severity, sex, and age. The majority of groups divided according to the GMDS quotients exhibited an unbalanced distribution in respect of the six domains of the GMDS and there were significant differences within the six subscale quotients. Autism severity, sex and age had significant effects on the overall level of development of autistic children. The quotients recorded for the children with more severe ASD were significantly lower than those for the children with less severe ASD. A markedly higher proportion of developmental delay was recorded for girls than boys in relation to the performance subscale. The locomotor quotient decreased in line with age at diagnosis, while autism severity and age had significant effects on the general and subscale quotients and sex had a significant effect on performance quotient. Children with ASD exhibit an uneven cognitive development profile, and their overall developmental levels are affected by autism severity, sex and age. Specific cognitive domains differ according to sex in children with ASD. Locomotor skills tend to decrease according to the age at diagnosis for autistic children aged 18 to 84 months. Autism severity and age are also associated with the level of functioning in different cognitive areas.

Consequently, in the present paper, a cry-based screening approach for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is introduced which would provide both early and automatic screening. During the study, we realized that ASD specific features are not necessarily observable in all children with ASD and in all instances collected from each child. Therefore, we proposed a new classification approach to be able to determine such features and their corresponding instances. To test the proposed approach a set of data relating to children between 18 to 53 months which had been recorded using high-quality voice recording devices and typical smartphones at various locations such as homes and daycares was studied. Then, after preprocessing, the approach was used to train a classifier, using data for 10 boys with ASD and 10 Typically Developed (TD) boys. The trained classifier was tested on the data of 14 boys and 7 girls with ASD and 14 TD boys and 7 TD girls. The sensitivity, specificity, and precision of the proposed approach for boys were 85.71%, 100%, and 92.85%, respectively. These measures were 71.42%, 100%, and 85.71% for girls, respectively. It was shown that the proposed approach outperforms the common classification methods. Furthermore, it demonstrated better results than the studies which used voice features for screening ASD. To pilot the practicality of the proposed approach for early autism screening, the trained classifier was tested on 57 participants between 10 to 18 months. These 57 participants consisted of 28 boys and 29 girls and the results were very encouraging for the use of the approach in early ASD screening.",pubmed,0.7807018178661764

Symptom severity for RRBs in ASD is associated with cognitive inflexibility. Thus, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive inflexibility in ASD is critical for tailoring therapies to treat this understudied yet pervasive symptom. Here we used a set-shifting paradigm adopted from the developmental cognitive neuroscience literature involving flexible switching between stimulus categories to examine task performance and neural responses in children with ASD. Behaviorally, we found little evidence for group differences in performance on the set-shifting task. Compared with typically developing children, children with ASD exhibited greater activation of the parahippocampal gyrus during performance on trials requiring switching. These findings suggest that children with ASD may need to recruit memory-based neural systems to a greater degree when learning to flexibly associate stimuli with responses. LAY SUMMARY: Children with autism often struggle to behave in a flexible way when faced with unexpected challenges. We examined brain responses during a task thought to involve flexible thinking and found that compared with typically developing children, those with autism relied more on brain areas involved in learning and memory to complete the task. This study helps us to understand what types of cognitive tasks are best suited for exploring the neural basis of cognitive flexibility in children with autism.

This included examining possible effects associated with the adaptation of the DSM-5 criteria for ASD, and the implementation of regulatory changes affecting eligibility for ASD-related stipends and services. ASD cases were ascertained based on electronic medical records review, with complete verification of ASD case status. Results indicated a substantial increase in ASD incidence rate (IR) over time that was overall not appreciably affected by the above changes. Cumulative incidence through age 8 rose from 0.46% (boys: 0.73; girls: 0.18) in 2007 to 1.30% (boys: 2.12; girls: 0.45) in 2018. Age-specific analyzes indicated that the largest increase in IR occurred in toddlers and preschool children, with a more modest increase at older age groups. Results suggest that the rise in early diagnosed ASD does not stem from a downward shift in the distribution of ages at first diagnosis, but rather from early detection of cases not previously diagnosed. Findings highlight the need to expand research aimed at identifying exogenous factors that may underlie the rise in incidence, and to evaluate factors that may contribute to late diagnosis of some cases.

We conducted a scoping review examining which telehealth approaches are used in the diagnosis and assessment of ASD in children and adults, whether they are feasible and acceptable, and how they compare with face-to-face diagnosis and assessment methods. A search for all peer-reviewed articles, combining the terms of autism and telehealth was conducted from 2000 to 2019. A total of 10 studies were identified for inclusion in the review. This review of the literature found there to be two methods of using telehealth: (a) Real-Time method e.g. video conferencing that enables teams in different areas to consult with the families and to assess the child/adult in real time and (b) A Store-and-Forward method as Naturalistic Observation Diagnostic Assessment (NODA) system to upload videos of child's behaviors to a webportal that enables the clinicians to make an assessment remotely. The findings were positive, finding there to be high agreement in terms of the diagnosis between remote methods and face to face methods and with high levels of satisfaction among the families and clinicians. This field is in the very early stages and so only studies with small sample size using surveys and interviews were identified but the findings suggest that there is potential for telehealth methods to improve access to assessment and diagnosis of ASD used in conjunction with existing methods, especially for those with clear autism traits and adults with ASD.

The results showed that language comprehension is the most impaired language domain in ASD. These findings have important clinical implications, since the persistence of grammatical receptive deficits may have a negative impact on social, adaptive and learning achievements. As for the grammatical profiles, persistent difficulties were found during the school-age years in morphological and syntactic decoding in children with relatively preserved cognitive and expressive language skills.

The current study examined rates of early skill attainment in 5-year-old children who participated in a comprehensive in-person assessment for NDDs in Hirosaki in Japan. Developmental milestone data were extracted from their Maternal and Child Health Handbook (MCHH), a booklet distributed to all pregnant women as part of universal health care. Seven hundred and twenty children underwent the assessment, among whom 455 received one or more NDD diagnoses (ASD: n = 124, non-ASD NDD: n = 331). Developmental skills were organized into four domains (motor, social interaction, communication, self-help), and the cumulative number of potential delays in each domain was calculated for each participant within three different age ranges (by 12 months, by 24 months, and by 36 months). Even by age 12 months, children with ASD/NDDs showed more potential delays across domains compared to those who received no NDD diagnosis. However, differences between those with ASD and those with non-ASD NDDs were not apparent until 24 months for social interaction and communication, and 36 months for self-help. These findings provide insights into specific behaviors that could be used to screen for ASD and other NDDs. In addition, the present study indicates the potential utility of the MCHH as a broadband screening tool to educate parents about what to look for in charting their child's early development. LAY SUMMARY: The present study examined prospectively charted developmental milestones from home-based records used as part of universal health care in 720 5-year-old children from Hirosaki, Japan. All children participated in a comprehensive evaluation to determine if they met criteria for a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Compared to those who received no NDD diagnosis, children with NDDs exhibited higher rates of potential delays across developmental domains, including social interaction, communication, and self-help. For some children, these delays were apparent before the age of 12 months. Differences between diagnostic groups became even more pronounced by 24 and 36 months, well before the average age of diagnosis.

The purpose of this research is to identify the informational needs of parents of children recently diagnosed with ASD as well as the barriers and facilitators encountered in their search for information. Methods Qualitative research using the focus group method was conducted with three groups of parents of young children or adolescents diagnosed with ASD within the last two years. Parents were recruited through a hospital clinic. Two groups were parents with one or more risk factors related to low health literacy: single parenthood, low level of schooling, unemployment, recent immigration. A qualitative content analysis was conducted to explore the process of searching for information on autism. Based on the theoretical framework of health literacy, various components were analyzed in terms of access, understanding, interpretation, and use of information for decision-making. Results The results display that there is a general lack of information on autism, as well as concerns about the quality of the information found on the Internet. All parents expressed difficulty understanding the information they found on their own or in the resources, they were offered. They also shared a desire to access sources of information that present autism in a positive way. The use of information for decision-making was limited. In addition, the obstacles encountered while searching for information revealed the importance of social support. Many of the parents reported feeling stigmatized and judged by others because of their child's behavior. Conclusions The results demonstrate the need to respond to the real informational needs of parents and to adapt the resources used during the diagnosis period, particularly for those with lower literacy levels. In addition, the way of communicating about the diagnosis needs to be reviewed. In order to address these literacy issues, it is important to offer various forms of social support in combination with informational support. In order to reduce psychological distress, it is necessary to provide support when announcing the diagnosis and raise awareness about autism to reduce the stigma experienced by autistic persons and their loved ones.",pubmed,0.7424313348766405

In a pleiotropic system, a single genetic variant contributes small effects to several phenotypes or disorders. While analyzed broadly, there is a paucity of research studies investigating the shared genetic information between specific neurodevelopmental domains and ASD. We performed a phenome-wide association study of ASD polygenetic risk score (PRS) against 491 neurodevelopmental subdomains ascertained in 4,309 probands from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) who lack an ASD diagnosis. Our main analysis calculated ASD PRS in 4,309 PNC probands using the per-SNP effects reported in a recent genome-wide association study of ASD in a case-control design. In a high-resolution manner, our main analysis regressed ASD PRS against 491 neurodevelopmental phenotypes with age, sex, and ten principal components of ancestry as covariates. Follow-up analyses included in the regression model PRS derived from brain-related traits genetically correlated with ASD. Our main finding demonstrated that 11-17-year old probands with the highest ASD genetic risk were able to identify angry faces (R2 = 1.06%, p = 1.38 × 10-7, pBonferroni-corrected = 1.9 × 10-3). This ability replicated in older probands (>18 years; R2 = 0.55%, p = 0.036) and persisted after covarying with other psychiatric disorders, brain imaging traits, and educational attainment (R2 = 0.2%, p = 0.019). We also detected several suggestive associations between ASD PRS and emotionality and connectedness with others. These data (i) indicate how genetic liability to ASD may influence neurodevelopment in the general population, (ii) reinforce epidemiological findings of heightened ability of ASD cases to predict certain social psychological events based on increased systemizing skills, and (iii) recapitulate theories of imbalance between empathizing and systemizing in ASD etiology.",pubmed,0.723325689973544

The diagnosis of ASD is currently primarily dependent upon descriptions of clinical symptoms, and it remains urgent to find biological markers for the detection and diagnosis of autism. The current study applied the urinary metabolic profiling approach to characterize metabolic phenotypes in ASD. MATERIAL AND METHODS Urine was obtained from children with ASD and their matched healthy siblings. Samples were analyzed using 1H NMR-based methods designed to measure a broad range of metabolites. Partial least-square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to develop models to identify metabonomic variations that can be used to distinguish between individuals with ASD and their unaffected siblings. RESULTS A significant difference was observed between the metabolomic profiles of children with ASD and that of their healthy siblings. An increase in the levels of tryptophan, hippurate, glycine, and creatine, and a decrease in trigonelline, melatonin, pantothenate, serotonin, and taurine were observed compared to the control group. We conclude that several metabolic pathways are affected by autism, which suggests that a gut-brain link may be important in the pathophysiology of ASD. CONCLUSIONS 1H NMR-based metabonomic analysis of the urine can determine perturbations of specific metabolic pathways related to ASD and help identify a characteristic metabolic fingerprint to better understand the disease and its causes.",pubmed,0.7207988167535947

The Screening and Linkage to Services for Autism trial evaluated the effect of family navigation on referral and evaluation for autism spectrum disorder in screen-positive toddlers. The trial was conducted in an urban, low-income population. It was designed to test ""real-world"" implementation of family navigation. We randomly assigned 275 children aged 16-30 months with an initial positive autism spectrum disorder screen to receive navigation if indicated or usual care. Navigation increased the number of at-risk toddlers who were evaluated for autism spectrum disorder. It also improved the quality of autism spectrum disorder screening in primary care clinics. However, many children failed to receive indicated referrals for evaluation. Navigation did not improve referral rates. Furthermore, nearly half of families who were potentially eligible for navigation could not be contacted. Other ways of structuring the navigation program may be necessary to improve families' access to and acceptance of navigation, especially in the setting of financial, cultural, and linguistic barriers. Our trial nevertheless showed that family navigation may be an important tool for reducing systemic inequalities in the early identification and treatment of young children with autism spectrum disorder.",pubmed,0.7123587833758066

Further, children born preterm are proposed to show a unique behavioral phenotype, which may overlap with characteristics of autism, making it difficult to disentangle their clinical presentation. To clarify the presentation of autism in children born preterm, this study examined differences in key indicators of child development (expressive language, receptive language, fine motor, and visual reception) and characteristics of autism (social affect and repetitive, restricted behaviors). <b>Materials and Methods:</b> One fifty-eight children (136 full-term, twenty-two preterm) diagnosed with autism, aged 22-34 months, were identified prospectively using the Social Attention and Communication Surveillance tools during community-based, developmental surveillance checks in the second year of life. Those identified at ""high likelihood"" of an autism diagnosis were administered the Mullen Scales of Early Learning and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. <b>Results:</b> The children born preterm and full-term did not differ significantly in their fine motor, visual reception, expressive language, or receptive language skills. No significant differences in social affect and repetitive and restrictive behavior traits were found. <b>Discussion:</b> The findings of this study differs from previous research where children diagnosed with autism born very or extremely preterm were developmentally delayed and had greater autistic traits than their term-born peers. These null findings may relate to the large proportion of children born moderate to late preterm in this sample. This study was unique in its use of a community-based, prospectively identified sample of children diagnosed with autism at an early age. It may be that children in these groups differ from clinic- and hospital-based samples, that potential differences emerge later in development, or that within the autism spectrum, children born preterm and full-term develop similarly. It was concluded that within the current sample, at 2 years of age, children diagnosed with autism born preterm are similar to their peers born full-term. Thus, when clinicians identify characteristics of autism in children born preterm, it is important to refer the child for a diagnostic assessment for autism.",pubmed,0.7102015042226236

Given the lack of specific pharmacological therapy for ASD and the clinical heterogeneity of the disorder, current biomarker research efforts are geared mainly toward identifying markers for determining ASD risk or for assisting with a diagnosis. A wide range of putative biological markers for ASD is currently being investigated. Proteomic analyses indicate that the levels of many proteins in plasma/serum are altered in ASD, suggesting that a panel of proteins may provide a blood biomarker for ASD. Serum samples from 76 boys with ASD and 78 typically developing (TD) boys, 18 months-8 years of age, were analyzed to identify possible early biological markers for ASD. Proteomic analysis of serum was performed using SomaLogic's SOMAScanTM assay 1.3K platform. A total of 1,125 proteins were analyzed. There were 86 downregulated proteins and 52 upregulated proteins in ASD (FDR < 0.05). Combining three different algorithms, we found a panel of 9 proteins that identified ASD with an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.8599±0.0640, with specificity and sensitivity of 0.8217±0.1178 and 0.835±0.1176, respectively. All 9 proteins were significantly different in ASD compared with TD boys, and were significantly correlated with ASD severity as measured by ADOS total scores.

Brain functional connectivity differences have been shown in both ASD and OWOB. However, only one study to date has examined ASD and OWOB concurrently, so little is known regarding the neural mechanisms associated with the higher prevalence of OWOB and its behavioral impacts in ASD. We investigated co-activation patterns (CAPs) of brain regions identified by independent component analysis in 129 children and adolescents between 6 and 18 years of age (n = 68 ASD). We examined the interaction between body mass index (BMI) and diagnosis in predicting dynamic brain metrics (dwell time, DT; frequency of occurrence, and transitions between states) as well as dimensional brain-behavior relationships. The relationship between BMI and brain dynamics was moderated by diagnosis (ASD, TD), particularly among the frequency of CAP 4, characterized by co-activation of lateral frontoparietal, temporal, and frontal networks. This pattern was negatively associated with parent-reported inhibition skills. Children with ASD had shorter CAP 1, characterized by co-activation of the subcortical, temporal, sensorimotor, and frontal networks, and CAP 4 DTs compared with TD children. CAP 1 DT was negatively associated with cognitive flexibility, inhibition, social functioning, and BMI. Cognitive flexibility moderated the relationship between BMI and brain dynamics in the visual network. Our findings provide novel evidence of neural mechanisms associated with OWOB in children with ASD. Further, poorer cognitive flexibility may result in increased vulnerability for children with ASD and co-occurring OWOB. LAY SUMMARY: Obesity is a societal epidemic and is common in autism, however, little is known about the neural mechanisms associated with the higher rates of obesity in autism. Here, we find unique patterns of brain dynamics associated with obesity in autism that were not observed in typically developing children. Further, the relationship between body mass index and brain dynamics depended on cognitive flexibility. These findings suggest that individuals with autism may be more vulnerable to the effects of obesity on brain function.",pubmed,0.7003759896694856

The present study focuses on social visual attention that i) is a main aspect of social attention reflecting social cognition and ii) its atypicalities have been suggested as a potential biomarker for ASD. Considering the possible shared background of both disorders and their comorbidity, it is important to compare such traits directly. Here, 73 children and adolescents paired for age and IQ diagnosed with ASD (N = 12), ADHD (N = 21), comorbid ASD + ADHD (N = 15), and ""typically developing"" (TD) controls (N = 25), were shown static real-life social scenes while their gaze movements were recorded with eye-tracking. Scenes with two levels of social complexity were presented: low complexity (one person depicted) and high (four interacting individuals). Gaze fixation variables were investigated. Fixation duration on faces was significantly reduced only in ASD + ADHD which also required longer time to fixate all faces at least once. Fixation duration on faces in ASD was reduced, compared to TD, only when looking at scenes with high versus low social complexity. ADHD individuals did not differ from TD. Concluding, the observed alterations of social visual attention support the existence of possible dysfunctional particularities differentiating ASD, ADHD, and ASD + ADHD, which can be revealed with the new method of eye-tracking technique.

In this study we considered a sample of 88 children who had been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, aged between 18 and 30 months. The following inclusion criteria were observed: age at the time of diagnosis less than 30 months, absence of other neurological, genetic, or sensorineural pathologies, and severity level 1 measured by symptoms evaluation based on the ADOS 2 module T (used for diagnosis). During the lockdown children experienced improvements in communication, socialization, and personal autonomy. During the three months after the ABA treatment, the acquired skills were maintained but no significant improvement was demonstrated. In this study, we describe how parent training was significant in avoiding delays in the generalization of socially significant behaviors, following the drastic interruption of the treatment in this group of children.",pubmed,0.6918423641260806

The aims of this study were to describe the incidence and characteristics of sleep disorders using a questionnaire completed by the caregiver in a sample of preschool-aged children with ASD and to identify possible differences in a control group of peers. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> Sleep disorders were investigated with the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) in a population of pre-school-aged (3-5 years) ASD children and in a control group. The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-second ed. (ADOS-2) was further used to assess autism symptom severity. A total of 84 children (69 males; mean age 3.9 ± 0.8 years) with a diagnosis of ASD and 84 healthy controls (65 males; mean age of 3.7 ± 0.8 years) that were matched for age and sex were enrolled. <i>Results:</i> ASD children reported significantly higher (pathological) scores than the control group on the SDSC total scores and in some of the factor scores, such as Difficulty in Initiating and Maintaining Sleep (DIMS), disorders of excessive somnolence (DOES), and sleep hyperhidrosis. A total of 18% of ASD children had a pathological SDSC total T-score, and 46% had an abnormal score on at least one sleep factor; DIMS, parasomnias, and DOES showed the highest rates among the sleep factors. Younger children (3 years) reported higher scores in DIMS and sleep hyperhidrosis than older ones (4 and 5 years). No specific correlation was found between ADOS-2 and SDSC scores. <i>Conclusions:</i> Pre-school children with ASD showed a high incidence of sleep disorders with different distributions of specific sleep factors according to their age. We suggest a screening assessment of sleep disorders using the SDSC in these children with a more in-depth evaluation for those reporting pathological scores on the questionnaire.",pubmed,0.6912207806635127

However, it is relatively unknown whether VMI impairments are specific to children with ASD versus children with other neurodevelopmental disorders. As such, this study addressed the hypothesis that children with ASD, but not those in other clinical control groups, would show greater deficits in high-VMI dynamic grip-force tracking versus low-VMI static presentation. Seventy-nine children, aged 7-17 years, participated: 22 children with ASD, 17 children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), 18 children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and 22 typically developing (TD) children. Two grip-force tracking conditions were examined: (1) a low-VMI condition (static visual target) and (2) a high-VMI condition (dynamic visual target). Low-frequency force oscillations <0.5 Hz during the visuomotor task were also examined. Two-way ANCOVAs were used to examine group x VMI and group x frequency effects (α = 0.05). Children with ASD showed a difficulty, above that seen in the ADHD/FASD groups, tracking dynamic, but not static, visual stimuli as compared to TD children. Low-frequency force oscillations <0.25 Hz were also significantly greater in the ASD versus the TD group. This study is the first to report VMI deficits during dynamic versus static grip-force tracking and increased proportion of force oscillations <0.25 Hz during visuomotor tracking in the ASD versus TD group. Dynamic VMI impairments may be a core psychophysiologic feature that could contribute to impaired development of motor and social-communicative skills in ASD. LAY SUMMARY: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show difficulties using dynamic visual stimuli to guide their own movements compared to their typically developing (TD) peers. It is unknown whether children without a diagnosis of ASD, but with other neurological disorders, show similar difficulties processing dynamic visual stimuli.

Many genes have been associated with autism, but only few highly penetrant. Some researchers have instead focused on oxidative stress, metabolic abnormalities and mitochondrial dysfunction as an explanation of the disorder. Currently no cure exists for the disorder, making these abnormalities interesting as they are possibly correctable with supplements or treatment. These various processes cannot be seen independently as they are influencing and interacting with each other. Furthermore many of the metabolic changes seen in autism have also been shown in other psychiatric disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder along with often comorbid disorders like epilepsy and intellectual disability. As such some of these abnormalities are not specific, however, could indicate a similar mechanism for the development of these disorders, with symptomatology and severity varying according to the location and the amount of damage done to proteins, cells and DNA.

We also sought to evaluate rate of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions among parents and explore the associations of this phenomenon in an exploratory fashion. 145 children with ASD and 127 control children were enrolled along with their mothers and fathers. Beck Depression Inventory and Maslach Burnout Inventory were used to evaluate parents' depression symptoms and burnout levels. Symptoms of children with ASDs were evaluated according to the Childhood Autism Rating Scale by the clinicians. Family, child and CAM variables were screened by means of a sociodemographic data form. Descriptive, bivariate and correlation analyses were used in statistical evaluations. Predictors of burnout were evaluated with multiple regression analysis. Burnout and depression levels among parents of children with ASD were significantly elevated compared to controls. Burnout levels of mothers were significantly elevated compared to fathers while depression scores of fathers were significantly elevated compared to mothers. Maternal burnout was significantly predicted by presence of functional speech in child while paternal burnout was significantly predicted by paternal vocation. Maternal depression was associated with paternal depression, lack of speech in child and attendance of child to special education services. Paternal depression was associated with autistic symptom severity and maternal depression. More than half the parents sought CAM interventions. Education level did not affect search for CAM interventions while both maternal and paternal psychopathology and presence of epilepsy among children increased use of CAM methods.

However, how flexible behavior changes developmentally in ASD remains largely unknown. Here, we used a developmental approach and examined flexible behavior on a probabilistic reversal learning task in 572 children, adolescents, and adults (ASD N = 321; typical development [TD] N = 251). Using computational modeling, we quantified latent variables that index mechanisms underlying perseveration and feedback sensitivity. We then assessed these variables in relation to diagnosis, developmental stage, core autism symptomatology, and associated psychiatric symptoms. Autistic individuals showed on average more perseveration and less feedback sensitivity than TD individuals, and, across cases and controls, older age groups showed more feedback sensitivity than younger age groups. Computational modeling revealed that dominant learning mechanisms underpinning flexible behavior differed across developmental stages and reduced flexible behavior in ASD was driven by less optimal learning on average within each age group. In autistic children, perseverative errors were positively related to anxiety symptoms, and in autistic adults, perseveration (indexed by both task errors and model parameter estimates) was positively related to RRB. These findings provide novel insights into reduced flexible behavior in relation to clinical symptoms in ASD.",pubmed,0.6596317825273832

The broadening of the diagnostic concept into the autism spectrum over the past few decades is associated with reduced neurocognitive differences between people with and without a diagnosis, and this has been argued to risk reducing our ability to understand mechanisms underlying autism.<sup>1</sup> Nevertheless, such expansion of diagnostic boundary and evolving nosology of autism reflects clinical reality, including increased recognition of autism-related disabilities and support needs of individuals and families. It also evolves with the acknowledgment of the transdiagnostic nature of shared mechanisms underlying the phenotypically overlapping neurodevelopmental and psychiatric categories and dimensions alongside autism (eg, intellectual disability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, executive function). This change inevitably comes with fuzzier diagnostic boundaries and markedly elevated heterogeneity. Autism, as we understand it today, is not a single spectrum. The more accurate concepts of ""autisms"" or ""autism plus"" comprise several spectra of characteristics that carry multilevel heterogeneity across etiology, neurobiology, developmental mechanisms, lived experiences, and behavioral presentations, despite the shared commonality at the 2 high-level constructs as per the current behavior-based definition of autism in DSM-5 and ICD-11 (ie, social-communication difficulties and restricted/repetitive behavior). This clinical reality urges us to take on the challenge of moving away from an autism versus nonautism case-control framework toward more effective ways to clarify heterogeneity<sup>2</sup> so that we can meaningfully understand individual differences with the goal of personalized intervention and support. In this context, Nordahl et al.<sup>3</sup> present an informative approach to meaningfully delineate heterogeneity in autism by considering its multispectral nature, brain-behavior relations, and sex effects.",pubmed,0.6528555386701724

Imitation and interpersonal synchrony impairments of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) might contribute to their difficulties in connecting and learning from others. Previous fMRI studies investigated cortical activation in children with ASD during finger/hand movement imitation; however, we do not know whether these findings generalize to naturalistic face-to-face imitation/interpersonal synchrony tasks. Using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the current study assessed the cortical activation of children with and without ASD during a face-to-face interpersonal synchrony task. Fourteen children with ASD and 17 typically developing (TD) children completed three conditions: a) Watch-observed an adult clean up blocks; b) Do-cleaned up the blocks on their own; and c) Together-synchronized their block clean up actions to that of an adult. Children with ASD showed lower spatial and temporal synchrony accuracies but intact motor accuracy during the Together/interpersonal synchrony condition. In terms of cortical activation, children with ASD had hypoactivation in the middle and inferior frontal gyri (MIFG) as well as middle and superior temporal gyri (MSTG) while showing hyperactivation in the inferior parietal cortices/lobule (IPL) compared to the TD children. During the Together condition, the TD children showed bilaterally symmetrical activation whereas children with ASD showed more left-lateralized activation over MIFG and right-lateralized activation over MSTG. Additionally, using ADOS scores, in children with ASD greater social affect impairment was associated with lower activation in the left MIFG and more repetitive behavior impairment was associated with greater activation over bilateral MSTG. In children with ASD better communication performance on the VABS was associated with greater MIFG and/or MSTG activation. We identified objective neural biomarkers that could be utilized as outcome predictors or treatment response indicators in future intervention studies.",pubmed,0.6522881395777245

Fifteen biological fathers of children with the diagnosis of autism (Test Group) and fifteen fathers of neurotypical children with no personal or family history of autism (Control Group) participated in this study. Facial emotion labeling task was evaluated using a set of photos consisting of six categories (mild and extreme: anger, happiness, and sadness).

Dynamic causal connectivity of neural sources signals was estimated using the multivariate autoregressive model and quantified by using the Granger causality-based methods. Statistical analysis showed significant differences (<i>p</i> value < 0.01) in the connectivity of neural sources in recognition of some emotions in two groups, which the most differences observed in the mild anger and mild sadness emotions. Short-range connectivity appeared in Test Group and conversely, long-range and interhemispheric connections are observed in Control Group. Finally, it can be concluded that the Test Group showed abnormal activity and connectivity in the brain network for the processing of emotional faces compared to the Control Group.

However, despite longstanding recommendations for earlier identification and intervention, there has been relatively slow progress in lowering the average age of diagnosis and enrollment in treatment for affected children. This has been due to several factors, including the inadequacy of behavioral risk markers and clinical practice entailing a ""wait to see"" or ""wait to fail"" approach to identification. Converging evidence now suggests that brain changes precede changes in behavior in children with ASD. This work has led to the discovery of potential biomarkers of presymptomatic or prodromal risk which may be used to accurately identify children at ultra-high risk during the first year of life. Such findings raise the possibility of intervention prior to the consolidation of core autistic features and during a period of substantial neural plasticity. While these avenues of research suggest strong potential for eventual clinical application, they also raise new questions regarding content, dosage, and timing of intervention as well as ethical, legal, and social considerations concerning presymptomatic identification and treatment.",pubmed,0.6443535758391984

Children and adult pedestrians with neurodevelopmental disorders may be at greater risk due to deficits in a range of domains, such as attention, social communication, motor control and executive function. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (American Psychological Association, 2013), neurodevelopmental disorders include individuals with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Specific Learning Disorder, Motor Difficulties, Communication Disorders and Intellectual Disabilities. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to explore existing literature relating to determine the nature of the risk faced by pedestrians with neurodevelopmental disorders. Relevant databases including Web of Science, PhysInfo and CINAHL were searched up to July 2019. All peer reviewed journals that presented data focusing on neurodevelopmental disorders and some aspect of road crossing or roadside behaviour that included a control or comparison group were included. A total of 149 abstracts were assessed and 17 met the inclusion criteria. The identified papers could be grouped into four areas: (1) rate of injury; (2) assessment of risk; (3) eye gaze and understanding of road layout and (4) gap choice. No papers exploring the risk factors at the roadside for individuals with Specific Learning Disorders or Communication Disorders were identified. Overall, the review provide evidence for an elevated risk of injury for individuals with ADHD at the roadside, potentially as a consequence of poor temporal gap choice, although there was evidence that this risk could be mediated by executive dysfunction rather than ADHD symptomology. Furthermore, poor temporal gap choice was found in children with DCD but it remains unclear as to whether this risk translates to the roadside. Finally, both children and adults with ASD and children with ID were found to demonstrate differences in behaviour / understanding at the roadside. In general, co-occurrence between neurodevelopmental disorders has been largely ignored in the current literature relating to pedestrian risk and future research could consider this along with executive functioning.",pubmed,0.643455327606406

<jats:p>One of the most crucial decisions to make for parents of children with Autism in Ghana (just like for others in most bilingual and multilingual environments) is what language(s) to use with their children. This study was conducted to first investigate the state of Autism in Ghana and then to unravel the language choices that parents make for their children and the factors that influence the choices they make. Through interviews, the use of observation and questionnaires, members of Autism Action Ghana, a support group for parents with children on the spectrum, were studied as a Community of Practice, as well as using Bourdieu’s concept of Cultural Capital. Data analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively revealed that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is still a generally unknown and misconceived condition that receives no major government attention, so that parents are left with finding very expensive and limited support for their children on their own. 77% of the 35 respondents use only English with their children because of the advice they receive from therapists, in addition to the fact that all therapies available are in English, the fear of further delaying speech in their non-verbal children should they use more than one language, and the belief that English has more currency and will take their children further in life as compared to their indigenous languages, among others. One of the implications of the choice of English is that the children will eventually become functionally monolingual in a multilingual country and thus will be left with no choice when it comes to language.</jats:p>",crossref,0.6390983506767515

The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task (or Eyes Test from now on) is widely used for this purpose. A recent study showed that subcategories of items of the children version of the Eyes Test could be especially discriminative to distinguish ASD and control children. Here, we analyzed the performance on the Eyes Test of 30 high functioning (IQ > 70) adults with ASD and 29 controls from the InFoR cohort multicentric study, using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. We found that valence and difficulty modulate the performance on the Eyes Test, with easy and positive items being the most discriminative to distinguish ASD and controls. In particular, we suggest this result might be actionable to discriminate ASD patients from controls in subgroups where their overall scores show less difference with controls. We propose for future research the computation of two additional indexes when using the Eyes Test: the first focusing on the easy and positive items (applying a threshold of 70% of correct responses for these items, above which people are at very low risk of having ASD) and the second focusing on the performance gain from difficult to easy items (with a progression of less than 15% showing high risk of having ASD). Our findings open the possibility for a major change in how the Eyes Test is used to inform diagnosis in ASD. LAY SUMMARY: The Eyes Test is used worldwide to inform autism spectrum disorders (ASD) diagnosis. We show here that ASD and neurotypical adults show the most difference in performance on subgroups of items: ASD adults do not improve as expected when comparing easy and difficult items, and they do not show an improvement for items displaying a positive feeling.

We fit regression models that included parent-reported ASD, family history of psychosis, lifetime trauma, executive function, processing speed, working memory, age, sex, race, ethnicity, and income-to-needs ratio as predictors of Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief Child (PQ-BC) distress score, a continuous index of PLS severity. We assessed cognitive differences using regression models with ASD/PLS status and relevant covariates as predictors of NIH Toolbox measures. ASD increased raw PQ-BC distress scores by 2.47 points (95% CI 1.33-3.61), an effect at least as large as Black race (1.27 points, 95% CI 0.75-1.78), family history of psychosis (1.05 points, 95% CI 0.56-1.54), and Latinx ethnicity (0.99 points, 95% CI 0.53-1.45. We did not identify differences in cognition for ASD+/PLS+ youth relative to other groups. Our finding of association between ASD and PLS in youth is consistent with previous literature and adds new information in suggesting that ASD may be a strong risk factor for PLS even compared to established SCZ risk factors.",pubmed,0.6330033424704326

However, little is known about the association between sleep and the cognitive phenotype in these clinical populations. Structural damage affecting cortical and subcortical connectivity occurs as a result of prenatal alcohol exposure in children with FASD, whilst it is believed an abundance of short-range connectivity explains the phenotypic manifestations of childhood ASD. These underlying neural structural and connectivity differences manifest as cognitive patterns, with some shared and some unique characteristics between FASD and ASD. This is the first study to examine sleep and its association with cognition in individuals with FASD, and to compare sleep in individuals with FASD and ASD. We assessed children aged 6-12 years with a diagnosis of FASD (<i>n</i> = 29), ASD (<i>n</i> = 21), and Typically Developing (TD) children (<i>n</i> = 46) using actigraphy (CamNTech Actiwatch 8), digit span tests of working memory (Weschler Intelligence Scale), tests of nonverbal mental age (MA; Ravens Standard Progressive Matrices), receptive vocabulary (British Picture Vocabulary Scale), and a choice reaction time (CRT) task. Children with FASD and ASD presented with significantly shorter total sleep duration, lower sleep efficiency, and more nocturnal wakings than their TD peers. Sleep was significantly associated with scores on the cognitive tests in all three groups. Our findings support the growing body of work asserting that sleep is significant to cognitive functioning in these neurodevelopmental conditions; however, more research is needed to determine cause and effect.",pubmed,0.6320877953292423

We analyzed data from the Autism Treatment Network (ATN) dataset for 2,576 children ages 6 to 18 years of age diagnosed with ASD. Multivariable logistic regression accounting for age, gender, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition - Text Revision), diagnosis (Autistic Disorder, PDD-NOS, Asperger's Disorder), and parents' education did not show any racial or ethnic differences in behavioral challenges, conduct problems, or sleep disturbances for any of the groups, but Black children had lower odds of Total Problem Behaviors and Asian children had lower odds of Hyperactivity compared to White children. As a group, children from racial and ethnic minorities had lower odds of Total Problem Behaviors and Conduct Problems compared to White children. Hispanic children had lower odds of medication use for Behavioral Challenges, Total Problem Behaviors, Hyperactivity, and Conduct Problems. Asian children had lower odds of medication use for Behavioral Challenges, Total Problem Behaviors, and Hyperactivity; and had close to lower odds in medication use for Conduct Problems. Black children had lower odds for medication use for Total Problem Behaviors only. As a group, children from racial and ethnic minorities had lower odds for medication use for Behavioral Challenges, Total Problem Behaviors, Hyperactivity, and Conduct problems, but not for Sleep Disturbances. While these results are consistent with previous studies showing that White children are significantly more likely to receive psychotropic medication compared to children from racial and ethnic minority groups, we found no such differences for sleep challenges, suggesting that they are more consistently identified and equitably treated than other behavioral problems associated with ASD. We draw upon Andersen's (1995) Behavioral Model of Healthcare Use to suggest predisposing, enabling, and needs factors that may contribute to this pattern of racial and ethnic differences in the use of medications among children ASD.",pubmed,0.629751364019741

While pervasive delays in motor behavior are common, formal diagnosis of Development Coordination Disorder (DCD) is uncommon. It is not clear how DCD and ID impact core deficits in ASD. This study utilized the Simons Foundation SPARK cohort to describe the scope of motor incoordination among children with ASD and examine the interrelationships between DCD risk, ID, and ASD core deficits. 10,234 children with ASD, between the ages of 5 and 15 years, were included in the analysis. Parents completed online versions of the DCD Questionnaire (DCD-Q), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) and Restrictive Behavior Scale (RBS-R). 85% of children with ASD had DCD-Q scores consistent with being at-risk for DCD, but only 14% reported a formal diagnosis. Children with ID exhibited significantly greater motor incoordination compared to children without ID (P < 0.001). Significantly, greater core deficits were identified in both children at-risk for DCD (P < 0.001) and with ID (P < 0.001). However, the effects of DCD risk were independent of ID and exhibited a medium effect size for SCQ (η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.063) and a small effect size for RBS-R (η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.04) scores. Collectively, study outcomes reinforce the pervasiveness of motor incoordination among children with ASD, both with and without concurrent ID, and provide further justification for the inclusion of motor behavior in the early intervention and prescription for children with ASD. LAY SUMMARY: This secondary data analysis of the Simons Foundation SPARK cohort found high rates (85%) of DCD risk among children with ASD. Deficits in motor coordination were greater among children with ASD with concurrent ID diagnoses.

However, a common genetic background as well as overlapping clinical features between ASD and CAS have been recently reported. To date, brain structural language-related abnormalities have been detected in both the conditions, but no study directly compared young children with ASD, CAS and typical development (TD). In the current work, we aim: (i) to test the hypothesis that ASD and CAS display neurostructural differences in comparison with TD through morphometric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based measures (ASD vs. TD and CAS vs. TD); (ii) to investigate early possible disease-specific brain structural patterns in the two clinical groups (ASD vs. CAS); (iii) to evaluate predictive power of machine-learning (ML) techniques in differentiating the three samples (ASD, CAS, TD). We retrospectively analyzed the T1-weighted brain MRI scans of 68 children (age range: 34-74 months) grouped into three cohorts: (1) 26 children with ASD (mean age ± standard deviation: 56 ± 11 months); (2) 24 children with CAS (57 ± 10 months); (3) 18 children with TD (55 ± 13 months). Furthermore, a ML analysis based on a linear-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) was performed. All but one brain structures displayed significant higher volumes in both ASD and CAS children than TD peers. Specifically, ASD alterations involved fronto-temporal regions together with basal ganglia and cerebellum, while CAS alterations are more focused and shifted to frontal regions, suggesting a possible speech-related anomalies distribution. Caudate, superior temporal and hippocampus volumes directly distinguished the two conditions in terms of greater values in ASD compared to CAS. The ML analysis identified significant differences in brain features between ASD and TD children, whereas only some trends in the ML classification capability were detected in CAS as compared to TD peers. Similarly, the MRI structural underpinnings of two clinical groups were not significantly different when evaluated with linear-kernel SVM. Our results may represent the first step towards understanding shared and specific neural substrate in ASD and CAS conditions, which subsequently may contribute to early differential diagnosis and tailoring specific early intervention.",pubmed,0.6271690210742497

A nationwide sample of 320 parents (age 50 or older) of adult children with ASD completed a web-based survey to understand use of formal and informal social support. Fisher's exact probability tests were used to determine significant differences in the extent to which the services were used by the two groups of caregivers. Results indicated that 4 of the 12 formal and 2 of the 6 informal social support services differed significantly between compound and noncompound caregivers.

Spatially constrained ICA was performed using resting-state fMRI from 419 children (autism spectrum disorder (ASD) = 105; typically developing (TD) = 314) to identify functional motor subdivisions. Comparing the spatial organization of each subdivision between groups, we found voxels that contributed significantly less to the right posterior cerebellar component in children with ASD versus TD (P <0.001). Next, we examined the effect of diagnosis on right posterior cerebellar connectivity with all other motor subdivisions. The model was significant (P = 0.014) revealing that right posterior cerebellar connectivity with bilateral dorsomedial primary motor cortex was, on average, stronger in children with ASD, while right posterior cerebellar connectivity with left-inferior parietal lobule (IPL), bilateral dorsolateral premotor cortex, and supplementary motor area was stronger in TD children (all P ≤0.02). We observed a diagnosis-by-connectivity interaction such that for children with ASD, elevated social-communicative and excessive repetitive-behavior symptom severity were both associated with right posterior cerebellar-left-IPL hypoconnectivity (P ≤0.001). Right posterior cerebellar and left-IPL are strongly implicated in visuomotor processing with dysfunction in this circuit possibly leading to anomalous development of skills, such as motor imitation, that are crucial for effective social-communication. LAY SUMMARY: This study examines whether communication between various brain regions involved in the control of movement are disrupted in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We show communication between the right posterior cerebellum and left IPL, a circuit important for efficient visual-motor integration, is disrupted in children with ASD and associated with the severity of ASD symptoms.

Patients with ASD and comorbidities are often difficult to diagnose because of the tendency to consider the multiple symptoms as the presentation of a complicated syndromic form. This view influences variant filtering which might ignore causative variants for specific clinical features shown by the patient. Here we report on a male child diagnosed with ASD, showing cognitive and motor impairments, stereotypies, hyperactivity, sleep, and gastrointestinal disturbances. The analysis of whole exome sequencing (WES) data with bioinformatic tools for oligogenic diseases helped us to identify two major previously unreported pathogenetic variants: a maternally inherited missense variant (p.R4122H) in <i>HUWE1</i>, an ubiquitin protein ligase associated to X-linked intellectual disability and ASD; and a <i>de novo</i> stop variant (p.Q259X) in <i>TPH2</i>, encoding the tryptophan hydroxylase 2 enzyme involved in serotonin synthesis and associated with susceptibility to attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). <i>TPH2</i>, expressed in central and peripheral nervous tissues, modulates various physiological functions, including gut motility and sleep.

Similarities include the following: it is important to be open and honest about the diagnosis; the diagnosis should be introduced/discussed as early as possible; discussions should be tailored to each individual child's needs; and we should not overlook the challenges associated with autism, but it is important to focus on positive aspects too. Differences include the following: autistic parents used personal experiences in conversations about autism, which was felt to result in increased understanding and empathy with their children; autistic parents overwhelmingly focused on more positive aspects of an autism diagnosis; our sample did not express concerns that discussions could have negative consequences too (e.g. making children more anxious); and autistic parents did not want or need professional support to talk about autism with their children (instead, they felt confident in using their own knowledge/experiences to guide discussions).",pubmed,0.6222386552563495

Serum samples of 39 children with ASD and 58 age-matched children with typical development were analysed. The ASD group showed decreased hydroxyl radical (<sup>·</sup>OH) and singlet oxygen scavenging activity with increased serum coenzyme Q10 oxidation rate, indicating a prooxidative tendency in ASD. By contrast, scavenging activities against superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>·-</sup>) and alkoxyl radical (RO<sup>·</sup>) were increased in the ASD group suggesting antioxidative shifts. In the subgroup analysis of 6-year-olds or younger, the combination of <sup>·</sup>OH, O<sub>2</sub><sup>·-</sup>, and RO<sup>·</sup> scavenging activities predicted ASD with high odds ratio (50.4), positive likelihood (12.6), and percentage of correct classification (87.0%).

In the first stage of our method, the OpenPose algorithm is used to obtain the initial skeleton data from the video of ASD children. Furthermore, four denoising methods are proposed to eliminate the noise of the initial skeleton data. In the second stage, we track multiple ASD children in the same scene by matching distance between current skeletons and previous skeletons. In the last stage, the neural network based on LSTM is proposed to classify the ASD children's actions.

The aims of the study were to explore metabolic perturbations in autism, to investigate whether the severity of autism core symptoms may be associated with specific metabolic signatures; and to examine whether the urine metabolome discriminates severe from mild-to-moderate restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped behaviors. We enrolled 57 children aged 2-11 years; thirty-one with idiopathic autism and twenty-six neurotypical (NT), matched for age and ethnicity. The urine metabolome was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The urinary metabolome of autistic children was largely distinguishable from that of NT children; food selectivity induced further significant metabolic differences. Severe autism spectrum disorder core deficits were marked by high levels of metabolites resulting from diet, gut dysbiosis, oxidative stress, tryptophan metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction. The hierarchical clustering algorithm generated two metabolic clusters in autistic children: 85-90% of children with mild-to-moderate abnormal behaviors fell in cluster II. Our results open up new perspectives for the more general understanding of the correlation between the clinical phenotype of autistic children and their urine metabolome.

What aspects of sensory processing are affected in autism? Although sensory processing can be studied along multiple dimensions, two of the most basic ones involve examining instantaneous sensory responses and how the responses change over time. These correspond to the dimensions of 'sensitivity' and 'habituation'. Results thus far have indicated that autistic individuals do not differ systematically from controls in sensory acuity/sensitivity. However, data from studies of habituation have been equivocal. We have studied habituation in autism using two measures: galvanic skin response (GSR) and magneto-encephalography (MEG). We report data from two independent studies. The first study, was conducted with 13 autistic and 13 age-matched neurotypical young adults and used GSR to assess response to an extended metronomic sequence. The second study involved 24 participants (12 with an ASD diagnosis), different from those in study 1, spanning the pre-adolescent to young adult age range, and used MEG. Both studies reveal consistent patterns of reduced habituation in autistic participants. These results suggest that autism, through mechanisms that are yet to be elucidated, compromises a fundamental aspect of sensory processing, at least in the auditory domain.

This cross-sectional study measured pubertal timing to examine hypothesized differences for sex (female vs. male) and group (ASD vs. typical development [TD]). Participants included 239 children (137 ASD, 102 TD) between 10 and 13 years. The ASD group included 35 females and 102 males; the TDs included 44 females and 58 males. Pubertal onset measured by genital or pubic stage was investigated with linear regression using main effects of sex and age-by-sex interactions in TD and ASD groups and main effects of diagnosis and diagnosis-by-age interactions in males and females, controlling for body mass index, socioeconomic status, and race. In TD, examination of main effects for genital (penis/breast) stage showed no difference for male and female children (t = 1.33, P = 0.187, rdf = 92); however, there were significant differences in ASD (t = 2.70, P = 0.008, rdf = 121).

The neurobiology of anxiety in ASD is unknown, but amygdala dysfunction has been implicated in both ASD and anxiety disorders. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we compared amygdala-prefrontal and amygdala-striatal connections across three demographically matched groups studied in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE): ASD with a comorbid anxiety disorder (N = 25; ASD + Anxiety), ASD without a comorbid disorder (N = 68; ASD-NoAnx), and typically developing controls (N = 139; TD). Relative to ASD-NoAnx and TD controls, ASD + Anxiety individuals had decreased connectivity between the amygdala and dorsal/rostral anterior cingulate cortex (dACC/rACC). The functional connectivity of these connections was not affected in ASD-NoAnx, and amygdala connectivity with ventral ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) circuits was not different in ASD + Anxiety or ASD-NoAnx relative to TD. Decreased amygdala-dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)/rACC connectivity was associated with more severe social impairment in ASD + Anxiety; amygdala-striatal connectivity was associated with restricted, repetitive behavior (RRB) symptom severity in ASD-NoAnx individuals. These findings suggest comorbid anxiety in ASD is associated with disrupted emotion-monitoring processes supported by amygdala-dACC/mPFC pathways, whereas emotion regulation systems involving amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) are relatively spared. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for comorbid anxiety for parsing ASD neurobiological heterogeneity.",pubmed,0.5857729883682555

It is, therefore, an important challenge to begin the diagnostic procedure of these children as soon as possible. Nowadays, much progress has been made in this respect compared with the past, but considerable work remains. A fundamental role in starting a correct and timely diagnostic procedure is obviously played by the pediatrician. Today, many tools are available for the early screening of autism in the general population, but unfortunately, their real effectiveness has yet to be established. In this narrative review, we address the topic of the early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, emphasizing, in particular, those that are now considered the first warning signs. We list a few of the most important signs to consider when a child aged around 18 months presents to a pediatrician, subdivided into three subgroups: social-communication skills; patterns of behavior, interests, or activities; and sensory behaviors and reactivity/temperament. We deal separately with the possible presence of slight motor signs, which can also go unnoticed, but probably they should be considered as very early signs appearing even before social-communication deficits.",pubmed,0.5833790522186253
268,1149,Whole Exome Sequencing Identifies Novel De Novo Variants Interacting with Six Gene Networks in Autism Spectrum Disorder.,2020-12-22 00:00:00,,Genes,E1,,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable condition caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors such as de novo and inherited variants, as well as rare or common variants among hundreds of related genes. Previous genome-wide association studies have identified susceptibility genes; however, most ASD-associated genes remain undiscovered. This study aimed to examine rare de novo variants to identify genetic risk factors of ASD using whole exome sequencing (WES), functional characterization, and genetic network analyses of identified variants using Korean familial dataset. We recruited children with ASD and their biological parents. The clinical best estimate diagnosis of ASD was made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5<sup>TM</sup>), using comprehensive diagnostic instruments. The final analyses included a total of 151 individuals from 51 families. Variants were identified and filtered using the GATK Best Practices for bioinformatics analysis, followed by genome alignments and annotation to the reference genome assembly GRCh37 (liftover to GRCh38), and further annotated using dbSNP 154 build databases. To evaluate allele frequencies of de novo variants, we used the dbSNP, gnomAD exome v2.1.1, and genome v3.0. We used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen) software to construct networks using all identified de novo variants with known autism-related genes to find probable relationships. We identified 36 de novo variants with potential relations to ASD; 27 missense, two silent, one nonsense, one splice region, one splice site, one 5' UTR, and one intronic SNV and two frameshift deletions. We identified six networks with functional relationships. Among the interactions between de novo variants, the IPA assay found that the NF-κB signaling pathway and its interacting genes were commonly observed at two networks. The relatively small cohort size may affect the results of novel ASD genes with de novo variants described in our findings. We did not conduct functional experiments in this study. Because of the diversity and heterogeneity of ASD, the primary purpose of this study was to investigate probable causative relationships between novel de novo variants and known autism genes. Additionally, we based functional relationships with known genes on network analysis rather than on statistical analysis. We identified new variants that may underlie genetic factors contributing to ASD in Korean families using WES and genetic network analyses. We observed novel de novo variants that might be functionally linked to ASD, of which the variants interact with six genetic networks.",pubmed,0.5830376704124941

Among these, sensory impairment, which is a core diagnostic feature of autism spectrum disorder, is often observed in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. However, the underlying mechanisms of symptoms that are shared across disorders remain unknown. To examine the neural correlates of sensory symptoms that are associated with autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, we analysed resting-state functional MRI data obtained from 113 people with either autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (<i>n </i>=<i> </i>78 autism spectrum disorder, mean age = 29.5; <i>n </i>=<i> </i>35 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mean age = 31.2) and 96 neurotypical controls (mean age = 30.6, range: 20-55 years) using a cross-sectional study design. First, we used a multi-dimensional approach to examine intrinsic brain functional connectivity related to sensory symptoms in four domains (i.e. low registration, sensation seeking, sensory sensitivity and sensation avoidance), after controlling for age, handedness and head motion. Then, we used a partial least squares correlation to examine the link between sensory symptoms related to intrinsic brain functional connectivity and neurodevelopmental symptoms measured using the Autism Spectrum Quotient and Conners' Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale, regardless of diagnosis. To test whether observed associations were specific to sensory symptoms related to intrinsic brain functional connectivity, we conducted a control analysis using a bootstrap framework. The results indicated that transdiagnostic yet distinct intrinsic brain functional connectivity neural bases varied according to the domain of the examined sensory symptom. Partial least squares correlation analysis revealed two latent components (latent component 1: <i>q </i><<i> </i>0.001 and latent component 2: <i>q </i><<i> </i>0.001). For latent component 1, a set of intrinsic brain functional connectivity was predominantly associated with neurodevelopmental symptom-related composite score (<i>r </i>=<i> </i>0.64, <i>P </i><<i> </i>0.001), which was significantly correlated with Conners' Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale total <i>T</i> scores (<i>r </i>=<i> </i>-0.99, <i>q </i><<i> </i>0.001). For latent component 2, another set of intrinsic brain functional connectivity was positively associated with neurodevelopmental symptom-related composite score (<i>r </i>=<i> </i>0.58, <i>P </i><<i> </i>0.001), which was eventually positively associated with Autism Spectrum Quotient total scores (<i>r </i>=<i> </i>0.92, <i>q </i><<i> </i>0.001). The bootstrap analysis showed that the relationship between intrinsic brain functional connectivity and neurodevelopmental symptoms was relative to sensory symptom-related intrinsic brain functional connectivity (latent component 1: <i>P </i>=<i> </i>0.003 and latent component 2: <i>P </i><<i> </i>0.001). The current results suggest that sensory symptoms in individuals with autism spectrum disorder and those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder have shared neural correlates.

Using clips from the library, we developed a brief training program to instruct students on diagnostic criteria for ASD and how to recognize examples of these behaviors in children. A randomized experimental trial compared the impact of the video-based training program delivered via the Internet to conventional graduate-level textbook training. Although both textbook and video-based training groups improved in their identification of ASD behaviors, the video-based training group significantly outperformed the textbook-based training group at posttest.

ASD cases (n = 200) were identified through the Department of Developmental Services and matched to live-birth population controls (n = 200) on birth month, year (2010-2011), and sex. Nonesterified PUFAs were measured by isotope dilution liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry from archived newborn dried blood spots and maternal mid-pregnancy serum samples. Crude and adjusted conditional logistic regression models were used to examine the association between neonatal PUFA levels, categorized in quartiles and according to distributional extremes, and ASD. Cubic splines were utilized to examine nonlinear relationships between continuous neonatal PUFAs and ASD. The correlation between neonatal and maternal levels was examined using Pearson correlation coefficients. In adjusted analyses of neonatal PUFA levels, no clear trends emerged, though there was an elevated odds ratio of ASD for the third quartile of linoleic acid, relative to the first (adjusted odds ratio = 2.49, 95% confidence interval: 1.31, 4.70). Cubic spline analysis suggested a nonlinear association between linoleic acid and ASD, though this was not robust to sensitivity analyses. While individual PUFAs were significantly correlated with one another within a given time point, aside from docohexaseanoic acid, PUFAs were not correlated across maternal and neonatal samples. Overall, our findings do not support an association between neonatal PUFA levels and ASD. Future work should confirm and expand these findings by examining associations with phenotypic subgroups and considering PUFAs in other time points.

Overall, we did not find strong evidence for hypothesized reduction in risk of ASD based on newborn levels of these fats.

185,1056,The Effect of a Combined Gluten- and Casein-Free Diet on Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2021-01-30 00:00:00,,Nutrients,470,,"There has been a growing interest in the gastrointestinal system and its significance for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including the significance of adopting a gluten-free and casein-free (GFCF) diet. The objective was to investigate beneficial and safety of a GFCF diet among children with a diagnosis of ASD. We performed a systematic literature search in Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and the Cochrane Library up to January 2020 for existing systematic reviews and individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies were included if they investigated a GFCF diet compared to a regular diet in children aged 3 to 17 years diagnosed with ASD, with or without comorbidities. The quality of the identified existing reviews was assessed using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR). The risk of bias in RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and overall quality of evidence was evaluated using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). We identified six relevant RCTs, which included 143 participants. The results from a random effect model showed no effect of a GFCF diet on clinician-reported autism core symptoms (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.31 (95% Cl. -0.89, 0.27)), parent-reported functional level (mean difference (MD) 0.61 (95% Cl -5.92, 7.14)) or behavioral difficulties (MD 0.80 (95% Cl -6.56, 10.16)). On the contrary, a GFCF diet might trigger gastrointestinal adverse effects (relative risk (RR) 2.33 (95% Cl 0.69, 7.90)). The quality of evidence ranged from low to very low due to serious risk of bias, serious risk of inconsistency, and serious risk of imprecision. Clinical implications of the present findings may be careful consideration of introducing a GFCF diet to children with ASD. However, the limitations of the current literature hinder the possibility of drawing any solid conclusion, and more high-quality RCTs are needed.

Children with this dual diagnosis display a linguistic profile that includes significant language delays and language impairments which often differ from the impairments observed in each developmental disability (DD) separately. Given the challenges observed with language acquisition for children with DS-ASD, concerns might be raised regarding the outcomes and suitability of a bilingual environment for children with this dual diagnosis specifically. The aim of this research was to explore the language profiles of four children with DS-ASD. A multiple case-study approach was employed. Four children with a confirmed DS-ASD diagnosis who had received exposure to two languages (English and Welsh) were assessed on a range of cognitive and linguistic measures. Performance was compared to three control groups; bilinguals with DS, English monolinguals with DS and mental age-matched typically developing bilinguals. Assessments comprised of expressive and receptive language, phonological awareness, working memory and non-verbal cognitive abilities. Considerable variability was found in the cognitive and linguistic profiles of the case-study participants. Children with DS-ASD displayed similar language profiles to that of the bilingual and monolingual children with DS in the areas tested, although performance was generally lower than that of the TD bilingual children. Although substantial variability was found, participants were developing bilingual abilities in a similar trajectory to children with DS in line with the degree of exposure to each language. This research highlights the need to assess bilingual children with complex dual diagnoses with an individualistic approach and carefully consider how to appropriately assess and treat bilingual children within speech and language therapy provisions.",pubmed,0.5706787988697952

In typical development, biological sex predicts inter-individual variation across multiple developmental milestones, with females often exhibiting earlier progression. The goal of this study was to examine sex differences in caregiver-reported developmental milestones (first word, phrase, walking) and their contribution to timing of initial concerns expressed by caregivers and eventual age of diagnosis. 195 (105 males) children and adolescents aged 8 to 17 years with a clinical diagnosis of ASD were recruited to the study (mean IQ = 99.76). While developmental milestones did not predict timing of diagnosis or age parents first expressed concerns, females had earlier first words and phrases than males. There was a marginal difference in the age of diagnosis, with females receiving their diagnosis 1 year later than males. Despite sex differences in developmental milestones and diagnostic variables, IQ was the most significant predictor in the timing of initial concerns and eventual diagnosis, suggesting children with lower IQ, regardless of sex, are identified and diagnosed earlier. Overall, biological sex and developmental milestones did not account for a large proportion of variance for the eventual age of ASD diagnosis, suggesting other factors (such as IQ and the timing of initial concerns) are potentially more influential. LAY SUMMARY: In this study, a later age of diagnosis in females having ASD was confirmed; however, biological sex was not the stronger predictor of age of diagnosis. Parents reported that females learned language more quickly than males, and parents noted their first concerns when females were older than males. In this sample, the strongest predictor of age of diagnosis was the age of first concerns.",pubmed,0.5700479005064423
792,1755,A Novel UHPLC-MS Method Targeting Urinary Metabolomic Markers for Autism Spectrum Disorder.,2020-11-02 00:00:00,,Metabolites,E443,,"Autism spectrum disorder is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disease. Currently, no biomarker of this disease is known. Diagnosis is performed through observation, standardized behavioral scales, and interviews with parents. In practice, diagnosis is often delayed to the average age of four years or even more which adversely affects a child's perspective. A laboratory method allowing to detect the disorder at earlier stages is of a great need, as this could help the patients to start with treatment at a younger age, even prior to the clinical diagnosis. Recent evidence indicates that metabolomic markers should be considered as diagnostic markers, also serving for further differentiation and characterization of different subgroups of the autism spectrum. In this study, we developed an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous determination of six metabolites in human urine. These metabolites, namely methylguanidine, N-acetyl arginine, inosine, indole-3-acetic acid, indoxyl sulfate and xanthurenic acid were selected as potential biomarkers according to prior metabolomic studies. The analysis was carried out by means of reversed-phase liquid chromatography with gradient elution. Separation of the metabolites was performed on a Phenomenex Luna<sup>®</sup> Omega Polar C18 (100 × 1.0 mm, 1.6 µm) column at a flow rate of 0.15 mL/min with acetonitrile/water 0.1% formic acid aqueous as the mobile phase. The analysis was performed on a group of children with autism spectrum disorder and age-matched controls. In school children, we have detected disturbances in the levels of oxidative stress markers connected to arginine and purine metabolism, namely methylguanidine and N-acetylargine. Also, products of gut bacteria metabolism, namely indoxyl sulfate and indole-3-acetic acid, were found to be elevated in the patients' group. We can conclude that this newly developed method is fast, sensitive, reliable, and well suited for the quantification of proposed markers.",pubmed,0.5690198091039117

The relationship between prenatal nutrients and gestational gene expression in mothers of children later diagnosed with ASD or non-typical development (Non-TD) is poorly understood. Maternal blood collected prospectively during pregnancy provides insights into the effects of nutrition, particularly one-carbon metabolites, on gene pathways and neurodevelopment. Genome-wide transcriptomes were measured with microarrays in 300 maternal blood samples in Markers of Autism Risk in Babies-Learning Early Signs. Sixteen different one-carbon metabolites, including folic acid, betaine, 5'-methyltretrahydrofolate (5-MeTHF), and dimethylglycine (DMG) were measured. Differential expression analysis and weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) were used to compare gene expression between children later diagnosed as typical development (TD), Non-TD and ASD, and to one-carbon metabolites. Using differential gene expression analysis, six transcripts (TGR-AS1, SQSTM1, HLA-C, and RFESD) were associated with child outcomes (ASD, Non-TD, and TD) with genome-wide significance. Genes nominally differentially expressed between ASD and TD significantly overlapped with seven high confidence ASD genes. WGCNA identified co-expressed gene modules significantly correlated with 5-MeTHF, folic acid, DMG, and betaine. A module enriched in DNA methylation functions showed a suggestive protective association with folic acid/5-MeTHF concentrations and ASD risk. Maternal plasma betaine and DMG concentrations were associated with a block of co-expressed genes enriched for adaptive immune, histone modification, and RNA processing functions. These results suggest that the prenatal maternal blood transcriptome is a sensitive indicator of gestational one-carbon metabolite status and changes relevant to children's later neurodevelopmental outcomes. LAY SUMMARY: Pregnancy is a time when maternal nutrition could interact with genetic risk for autism spectrum disorder. Blood samples collected during pregnancy from mothers who had a prior child with autism were examined for gene expression and nutrient metabolites, then compared to the diagnosis of the child at age three. Expression differences in gene pathways related to the immune system and gene regulation were observed for pregnancies of children with autism and non-typical neurodevelopment and were associated with maternal nutrients.",pubmed,0.5656782652409659

The NDD group consisted of adults with autism spectrum disorder ASD (n = 183) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (n = 174) without intellectual disability, recruited from a tertiary outpatient clinic. A web survey was used to collect data from general population adult control group without NDD (n = 738). The participants were retrospectively rated by their parents regarding childhood symptoms, using five to fifteen-collateral informant questionnaire (FTF-CIQ). Adults with NDD had higher FTF-CIQ domain and subdomain scores than controls, and displayed similar test profiles as children with corresponding diagnosis in previous studies. Based on the FTF-CIQ domain scores, 84.2% of the study participants (93% of the controls; 64% of the adults with NDD) were correctly classified in a logistic regression analysis. Likewise, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis on FTF-CIQ total sum score indicated that a cut-off value of 20.50 correctly classified 90% of the controls and 67% of the clinical cases, whilst a cut-off value of 30.50 correctly classified 84% of the controls and 77% of the clinical cases. The factor analysis revealed three underlying components: learning difficulties, cognitive and executive functions; social skills and emotional/behavioural symptoms; as well as motor and perceptual skills. Whilst not designed as a diagnostic instrument, the FTF-CIQ may be useful for providing information on childhood symptoms and associated difficulties in individuals assessed for NDD as adults.",pubmed,0.5652323134382297

Research on typical development demonstrates that contact with the referent and handshape when pointing, are associated with different communicative intentions and developmental stages. Despite their importance, the morphological features of pointing remain largely unexplored in autism. The aim of the present study was to map out pointing production in autism with a focus on handshape and contact with the referent. Participants (age range = 1-6 years old) with ASD (n = 16), at high risk for autism (n = 13) and typically developing children (n = 18) interacted with their caregivers in a gesture elicitation task. Results showed that children with ASD produced fewer pointing gestures overall and fewer index finger pointing without contact with the referent compared to the typically developing children. LAY SUMMARY: Children with autism produce less gestures than typical children, and pointing gestures appear to be more affected than other gesture types. Whether children point using their index finger or the palm, and whether they touch or not the referent is crucial for understanding communicative intentions. This is the first study to document experimentally exactly how pointing gestures differ in autism in comparison to typical development. We found important qualitative differences in the communicative patterns of children with autism and at risk for autism, that may serve to identify potential new markers for early diagnosis.",pubmed,0.5650226679047777

The present study shows how implementing a second-order diagnostic measure to high risk cases initially flagged positive from screening tools can further inform clinical judgment and substantially improve early identification. We use two example measures for the purposes of this demonstration; a saliva test and eye-tracking technology, both scalable and easy-to-implement biomarkers recently introduced in ASD research. Results of the current cost-savings analysis indicate that lifetime societal cost savings in special education, medical and residential care are estimated to be nearly $580,000 per ASD child, with annual cost savings in education exceeding $13.3 billion, and annual cost savings in medical and residential care exceeding $23.8 billion (of these, nearly $11.2 billion are attributable to Medicaid). These savings total more than $37 billion/year in societal savings in the US. Initiating appropriate interventions faster and reducing the number of unnecessary diagnostic evaluations can decrease the lifetime costs of ASD to society. We demonstrate the value of implementing a scalable highly accurate diagnostic in terms of cost savings to the US. LAY SUMMARY: This paper demonstrates how biomarkers with high accuracy for detecting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) could be used to increase the efficiency of early diagnosis. Results also show that, if more children with ASD are identified early and referred for early intervention services, the system would realize substantial costs savings across the lifespan.",pubmed,0.565012825604345

This study aimed to investigate the progressive structural alterations in the autistic brain during early childhood. Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were examined in a cross-sectional sample of 67 autistic children and 63 demographically matched typically developing (TD) children, aged 2-7 years. Voxel-based morphometry and a general linear model were used to ascertain the effects of diagnosis, age, and a diagnosis-by-age interaction on the gray matter volume. Causal structural covariance network analysis was performed to map the interregional influences of brain structural alterations with increasing age. The autism group showed spatially distributed increases in gray matter volume when controlling for age-related effects, compared with TD children. A significant diagnosis-by-age interaction effect was observed in the fusiform face area (FFA, Fpeak = 13.57) and cerebellum/vermis (Fpeak = 12.73). Compared with TD children, the gray matter development of the FFA in autism displayed altered influences on that of the social brain network regions (false discovery rate corrected, P < 0.05).

However, limited research has investigated the heterogeneity of the visual preferences in individuals with ASD. In the current study, we explored the visual preferences to different movement types (repetitive, biological, and random) in children with ASD using a paired preferential looking paradigm. Thirty-nine children with ASD and 37 typically developing (TD) children participated in our study, with their eye movements recorded as the index of visual preferences. We examined the differences of visual preferences between the ASD and TD group, and the heterogeneity of visual preferences within the ASD group. We found group differences between children with ASD and TD children: Overall, the ASD group preferred repetitive movements while the TD group preferred biological movements. We also detected heterogeneity of visual preferences within the ASD group: Although the majority of children with ASD preferred repetitive movements as previous studies reported, 9 out of 39 children with ASD preferred biological movements similarly as their TD peers. Moreover, the visual preference patterns were correlated with autistic symptoms, especially the socio-communicative impairments. Our study provided evidence of heterogeneity of visual attention and main visual preference to repetitive movements in children with ASD.

These may generate differences with non-autistic children in the integration of relevant social information to set the basis of communication. Reliable and objective measurement of these characteristics in a language learning context could contribute to a more accurate early diagnosis of ASD. Gaze following and pupil dilation are being studied as possible reliable measures of visual attention for the early detection of ASD. The eye-tracking methodology allows objective measurement of these biomarkers. The aim of this study is to determine whether measurements of gaze following and pupillary dilation in a linguistic interaction task are potential objective biomarkers for the early diagnosis of ASD. <i>Method</i>: A group of 20 children between 17 and 24 months of age, made up of 10 neurotypical children (NT) and 10 children with an increased likelihood of developing ASD were paired together according to chronological age. A human face on a monitor pronounced pseudowords associated with pseudo-objects. Gaze following and pupil dilation were registered during the task These measurements were captured using eye-tracking methodology. <i>Results</i>: Significant statistical differences were found in the time of gaze fixation on the human face and on the object, as well as in the number of gazes. Children with an increased possibility of developing ASD showed a slightly higher pupil dilation than NT children. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, their pupil dilation was uniform throughout the different periods of the task while NT participants showed greater dilation on hearing the pseudoword. <i>Conclusions</i>: The fixing and the duration of gaze, objectively measured by a Tobii eye-tracking system, could be considered as potential biomarkers for early detection of ASD.

Yet, little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying speech segmentation in typical development and in neurodevelopmental disorders that impact language acquisition such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here, we investigate the neural signals of statistical learning in 15 human participants (children ages 8-12) with a clinical diagnosis of ASD and 14 age-matched and gender-matched typically developing peers. We tracked the evoked neural responses to syllable sequences in a naturalistic statistical learning corpus using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in the left primary auditory cortex, posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), across three repetitions of the passage. In typically developing children, we observed a neural index of learning in all three regions of interest (ROIs), measured by the change in evoked response amplitude as a function of syllable surprisal across passage repetitions. As surprisal increased, the amplitude of the neural response increased; this sensitivity emerged after repeated exposure to the corpus. Children with ASD did not show this pattern of learning in all three regions. We discuss two possible hypotheses related to children's sensitivity to bottom-up sensory deficits and difficulty with top-down incremental processing.",pubmed,0.5587134622365072

We conducted a prospective cohort study to identify the reasons for differences in ASD rates between the Bedouin and Jewish populations in southern Israel. Screening, referral, and diagnosis of toddlers aged 16-36 months were compared between Bedouin and Jewish populations. ASD screening was conducted at 35 randomly selected mother and child health centers (MCHCs) by trained nurses using the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers with follow-up (M-CHAT/F) instrument. Toddlers screened positive at the MCHCs were monitored throughout the referral and diagnosis process at a single medical center until a diagnosis was determined by a physician specialist using DSM-5 criteria. The study cohort comprised 3,343 toddlers (996 Jewish and 2,347 Bedouin). Bedouin toddlers, compared to Jewish toddlers, were less likely to screen positive with M-CHAT/F (3.0% vs. 3.9%; P = 0.165), were significantly less likely to begin the hospital diagnosis process (HR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.14-1.08; P = 0.068), and had a higher rates of loss-to-follow-up during the hospital diagnosis process (42.9% vs. 15.6%, respectively; P = 0.001). The results suggest that ethnic-specific barriers in the diagnosis process of ASD contribute to under-diagnosis of ASD in the Bedouin population. Facilitating the diagnosis process for Bedouin families will help to identify more children with ASD at earlier ages and consequently close the ethnic gap in ASD rates. LAY SUMMARY: We followed Bedouin and Jewish toddlers aged 16-36 months from southern Israel through their autism spectrum disorder (ASD) screening referral and diagnosis to identify the reasons for the differences in ASD prevalence between these ethnic groups.

Little is known about whether these metabolic issues contribute to the symptoms or severity of these disabilities, or whether sex plays a role in these associations, given that boys are disproportionately affected by some developmental disabilities. Here we sought to investigate the correlation between psychometric scores, sex, and the plasma metabolome. <b>Methods:</b> The plasma metabolomes of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; <i>n</i> = 167), idiopathic developmental delay (i-DD; <i>n</i> = 51), Down syndrome (DS; <i>n</i> = 31), and typically developing controls (TD; <i>n</i> = 193) were investigated using NMR spectroscopy. Spearman rank correlations and multiple linear regression models (adjusted for child's neurodevelopmental diagnosis, child's sex, child's age, child's race/ethnicity, maternal age at child's birth, and parental homeownership) were used to examine the association between plasma metabolites and sex in relation to psychometric measures of cognitive skills, adaptive behavior, and maladaptive behavior in our study population. <b>Results:</b> Higher levels of metabolites involved in cellular energy and mitochondrial function among children with ASD (fumarate and cis-aconitate), DS (lactate), and TD (pyruvate) are associated with poorer cognitive and adaptive subscales. Similarly, higher o-acetylcarnitine associated with deficits in cognitive subscales among all DS cases and TD boys, and carnitine correlated with increased maladaptive behavior among girls with ASD and girls with DS. Among children with DS, elevated myo-inositol, ornithine, and creatine correlated with poorer scores across several subscales. Even among TD cases, elevated 3-hydroxybutyrate correlated with decreased receptive language. In contrast, higher levels of glutamate were associated with better socialization skills among ASD cases. Even after adjusting for the child's neurodevelopmental diagnosis, sex, and other possible confounders, key metabolites including glycolysis metabolites (lactate and pyruvate), ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate), TCA cycle metabolites (cis-aconitate and fumarate), as well as ornithine were associated with deficits in multiple domains of cognitive function, adaptive skills, and aberrant behaviors. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our results highlight that some plasma metabolites may relate to specific functional subdomains within cognitive, adaptive, and behavioral development with some variation by diagnosis and sex.",pubmed,0.5551326430038067

This paper presents the results of a meta-analysis to determine whether the weight of the evidence supports such an association. Studies with a categorical diagnosis of autism as the outcome and an assessment of its association with prenatal maternal infection or fever (or the data necessary to compute this association) were included. A total of 36 studies met these criteria. Two independent reviewers extracted data on study design, methods of assessment, type of infectious agent, site of infection, trimester of exposure, definition of autism, and effect size. Analyses demonstrated a statistically significant association of maternal infection/fever with autism in offspring (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.20-1.46). Adjustment for evident publication bias slightly weakened this association. There was little variation in effect sizes across agent or site of infection. Small differences across trimester of exposure were not statistically significant. There was some evidence that recall bias associated with status on the outcome variable leads to differential misclassification of exposure status. Nonetheless, the overall association is only modestly reduced when studies potentially contaminated by such bias are removed. Although causality has not been firmly established, these findings suggest maternal infection during pregnancy confers an increase in risk for autism in offspring. Given the prevalence of this risk factor, it is possible that the incidence of autism would be reduced by 12%-17% if maternal infections could be prevented or safely treated in a timely manner. LAY SUMMARY: This study is a meta-analysis of the association of maternal infection during pregnancy and subsequent autism in offspring. In combining the results from 36 studies of this association we find that a significant relationship is present. The association does not vary much across the types of infections or when they occur during pregnancy. We conclude that the incidence of autism could be substantially reduced if maternal infections could be prevented or safely treated in a timely manner.",pubmed,0.5548927699821248

The RASopathies, a group of disorders caused by mutations of the Ras/MAPK pathway genes, share many overlapping clinical features. Studies suggest a high prevalence of ASD in the RASopathies, but detailed characterization of the ASD profile is lacking. The aim of this study was to compare the ASD symptom profile of three distinct RASopathies associated with both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations: neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Noonan syndrome (NS), and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC). Participants were drawn from existing databases if they had a diagnosis of a RASopathy, met the criteria for ASD, and were able to communicate verbally. We compared the phenotypic profile of NF1 + ASD (<i>n</i> = 48), NS + ASD (<i>n</i> = 11), and CFC + ASD (<i>n</i> = 7) on the Autism Diagnostic Inventory (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). We found subtle but non-significant group differences with higher levels of social impairments and lower restricted repetitive behaviors in the NF1 group as compared with the NS and CFC groups. We observed group differences in developmental milestones with most severe delays in CFC, followed by NS and NF1. Our results suggest that despite developmental differences, the ASD profile remains relatively consistent across the three RASopathies. Though our results need confirmation in larger samples, they suggest the possibility that treatment and mechanistic insights developed in the context of one RASopathy may be generalizable to others and possibly to non-syndromic ASD associated with dysregulation of Ras/MAPK pathway genes.",pubmed,0.5541961835061245

However, the behavioral and genetic architecture of RSB in toddlerhood, when ASD first emerges, has not been fully characterized. We analyzed data from a quantitative video-referenced rating of RSB (vrRSB) in two toddler samples: a community-based volunteer research registry (n = 1,563) and an ethnically diverse, longitudinal twin sample ascertained from two state birth registries (n = 714). Variation in RSB was continuously distributed, temporally stable, significantly associated with ASD risk at age 18 months, and only modestly explained by sociodemographic and medical factors (r2 = 9.4%). Five latent RSB factors were identified and corresponded to aspects of social communication or restricted repetitive behaviors, the two core ASD symptom domains. Quantitative genetic analyses indicated substantial heritability for all factors at age 24 months (h2 ≥ .61). Genetic influences strongly overlapped across all factors, with a social motivation factor showing evidence of newly-emerging genetic influences between the ages of 18 and 24 months. RSB constitutes a heritable, trait-like competency whose factorial and genetic structure is generalized across diverse populations, demonstrating its role as an early, enduring dimension of inherited variation in human social behavior. Substantially overlapping RSB domains, measurable when core ASD features arise and consolidate, may serve as markers of specific pathways to autism and anchors to inform determinants of autism's heterogeneity.",pubmed,0.5501642930789937

Using mobile eye-tracking glasses in a standardized diagnostic setting while applying the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2), we had the opportunity to record gaze behavior of children and adolescents with and without Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASCs) during social interaction. The objective was to investigate differences in eye-gaze behavior between three groups of children and adolescents either (1) with ASC or (2) with unconfirmed diagnosis of ASC or (3) with neurotypical development (NTD) during social interaction with an adult interviewer in a diagnostic standard situation using the ADOS-2. In a case control study, we used mobile eye-tracking glasses in an ecologically valid and highly standardized diagnostic interview to investigate suspected cases of ASC. After completion of the ASC diagnostic gold standard including the ADOS-2, the participants were assigned to two groups based on their diagnosis (ASC vs. non-ASC) and compared with a matched group of neurotypically developed controls. The primary outcome measure is the percentage of total dwell times assessed for different areas of interest (AOI) with regard to the face and body of a diagnostic interviewer and the surrounding space. Overall, 65 children and adolescents within an age range of 8.3–17.9 years were included in the study. The data revealed significant group differences, especially in the central-face area. Previous investigations under laboratory conditions gave preferential attention to the eye region during face perception to describe differences between ASC and NTD. In this study – using an ecologically valid setting within a standard diagnostic procedure – the results indicate that neurotypically developed controls seem to process faces and facial expressions in a holistic manner originating from the central-face region. Conversely, participants on the Autism Spectrum (tAS) seem to avoid the central-face region and show unsystematic gaze behavior, not using the preferred landing position in the central-face region as the Archimedean point of face perception. This study uses a new approach, and it will be important to replicate these preliminary findings in future research.</jats:p>",crossref,0.5487311366074167

We reconsider whether executive function (EF) accounts of RRBs should be revisited. EF deficits and high levels of RRBs are often pronounced in individuals with ASD and are also prevalent in young typically developing children. Despite this, the evidence is mixed, and there has been no systematic attempt to evaluate the relationship across studies and between task batteries. We examine recent evidence, and in three highly powered random-effects analyses (N = 2964), examine the strength of the association between RRB levels and performance on set shifting, inhibitory control, and parental-report based EF batteries. The analyses confirm significant associations between high levels of the behaviors and poor EF skills. Moreover, the associations remained stable across typical development and in individuals with ASD and across different types of EF measures. These meta-analyses consolidate recent evidence identifying that cognitive mechanisms correlate with high RRBs that are seen in individuals with ASD, as well as in typical development. We propose that the EF account may be critical for guiding future interventions in ASD research. LAY SUMMARY: Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are diagnostic criteria for Autism yet also common in typical development, and if they persist over time some can have a negative impact on learning and social acceptance. The present meta-analyses found that high levels of RRBs related to poor performance on set-shifting and inhibitory control tasks, as well as high ratings on parental report scales. Future studies should create interventions that aim to improve these skills as they may help manage challenging RRBs.",pubmed,0.5433936222962692

We conducted a population-based case-control study in California to examine the association between PUFAs measured in midpregnancy serum samples and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. ASD cases (n = 499) were identified through the California Department of Developmental Services and matched to live-birth population controls (n = 502) on birth month, year (2010 or 2011), and sex. Logistic regression models were used to examine crude and adjusted associations. In secondary analyses, we examined ASD with and without co-occurring intellectual disability (ID; n = 67 and n = 432, respectively) and effect modification by sex and ethnicity. No clear patterns emerged, though there was a modest inverse association with the top quartile of linoleic acid level (highest quartile vs. lowest: adjusted odds ratio = 0.74, 95% confidence interval: 0.49, 1.11; P for trend = 0.10).

Although inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are rare causes of ASD, they are significant for several reasons, including implications in genetic counseling and determination of prognosis. In this article, we present a 6-year-old boy who presented to us with ASD and was diagnosed with creatine transporter deficiency. Physical and neurologic examination of this patient had not previously raised suspicion of IEM, but twin pregnancy, prematurity, NICU stay due to necrotizing enterocolitis, transient infantile hypotonia, gross-motor delay, breath-holding spells, and a single febrile seizure complicated the history. MRI revealed mild T2-hyperintensity in posterior periventricular white matter. Further evaluation with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which showed a decreased creatine peak, led to diagnostic investigations for disorders of creatine metabolism, revealing increased urinary creatine:creatinine ratio and a de novo, novel hemizygous frameshift variant in <i>SLC6A8</i> Clinicians are advised to maintain a high index of suspicion for IEM and to evaluate patients with ASD for syndromic features. Although current guidelines from relevant organizations differ in their recommendations regarding the necessity and the extent of metabolic screening in ASD, there is a growing trend toward screening for treatable IEM. In this case report, we present challenges and pitfalls in the diagnostic journey for creatine transporter deficiency and underline the significance of a thorough history and physical examination in the evaluation of a child with ASD.",pubmed,0.5248040471709239

We contribute to this body of work by examining the process of resolving contradiction in autism diagnosis for adults and adolescents. Autism is a useful case study as diagnosis can be a complex and protracted process due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and the necessity to interpret behaviours that may be ambiguous. We audio-recorded and transcribed 18 specialist clinical assessment meetings in four teams in England, covering 88 cases in two adult, one child and one adolescent (14+) setting. We undertook a qualitative analysis of discursive processes and narrative case-building structure utilised by clinicians to counteract contradiction.We identified a three-part interactional pattern which allows clinicians to forward evidence for and against a diagnosis, facilitates their collaborative decision-making process and enables them to build a plausible narrative which accounts for the diagnostic decision. Pragmatism was found to operate as a strategy to help assign diagnosis within a condition which, diagnostically, is permeated by uncertainty and contradiction. Resolution of contradiction from different aspects of the assessment serves to create a narratively-coherent, intelligible clinical entity that is autism.",pubmed,0.5171662654148955

We examined the rates of death in children and young people in Scotland using recorded information in Scotland's annual pupil census, linked to the National Records of Scotland deaths register, between 2008 and 2015. In total, 9754 (1.2%) out of 787,666 pupils had autism. Six pupils with autism died in the study period, compared with 458 other pupils. This was equivalent to 16 per 100,000 for pupils with autism and 13 per 100,000 pupils without autism; hence, the rate of death was very similar. In the pupils with autism, the most common causes of death were diseases of the nervous system, whereas they were from external causes in the comparison pupils. The autism group had some deaths due to epilepsy which might have been prevented by good quality care. We cautiously conclude that the death rate in the current generation of children and young adults with autism is no higher than for other children, but that even in this high-income country, some deaths could be prevented by high quality care.",pubmed,0.515799200810996

No prior study has shown a-syn levels in ASD patients' saliva. Objective  This study estimates the levels of alpha-synuclein monomer (a-syn-mono) and alpha-synuclein oligomer (a-syn-oligo) in the saliva of ASD affected children so that saliva can be a method for detecting disorder. Materials and methods This cross-sectional, multi-center study was conducted in Islamic International Medical College, Autism Resource Centre (ARC), and Step-to-learn Rehabilitation center for the slow learner in Rawalpindi. The research was performed for one year from August 2018 to August 2019. Saliva samples from 80 children (40 ASD affected children, and 40 age- and sex-comparable healthy controls) were collected. Specific anti-alpha-synuclein monomers (anti-a-syn-mono) and anti-alpha-synuclein oligomers (anti-a-syn-oligo) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits analyzed the salivary samples. Mean ± SD were reported for quantitative data. The data between the two groups were compared using an independent t-test. The p-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 80 children were included in the study (n=40 ASD affected, n=40 healthy controls). The age of participating children was between four and eight years. The mean alpha-synuclein monomer level in the saliva of ASD children was 92.03 ± 117.09 pg/ml (p≤0.05), and in healthy subjects was 186.78 ± 239.31 ρg/ml.

Each participant's functional network graphs were computed using five graph metrics. In diagnosis-based comparisons, an analysis of covariance was performed to compare all NDDs to TD, followed by pairwise comparisons between NDDs. In the dimensional approach, participants' functional network graphs were correlated with continuous behavioural measures, and a data-driven k-means clustering analysis was applied to determine if subgroups of participants were seen, without diagnostic information having been included. In the diagnosis-based comparisons, children with NDDs did not differ significantly from the TD group and the NDD categorical groups also did not differ significantly from each other, across all graph metrics. In the dimensional, diagnostic-independent approach, however, subcortical functional connectivity was significantly correlated with participants' general adaptive functioning across all participants. The clustering analysis identified an optimal solution of two clusters, and participants assigned in the same data-driven cluster were highly heterogeneous in diagnosis. Neither cluster exclusively contained a specific diagnostic group, nor did NDDs separate cleanly from TDs. Each participant's distance ratio between the two clusters was significantly correlated with general adaptive functioning, social deficits and attentional problems. Our results suggest the neurobiological similarity and dissimilarity between NDDs need to be investigated beyond DSM/ICD-based, behaviourally-defined diagnostic categories.",pubmed,0.5092586327232406

Our researchers - independent of the AOSI development team and newly trained on this measure - were able to administer the brief interactive assessment and score it accurately. The infants' AOSI scores were linked to their scores on other established and validated clinical assessments, particularly at the second visit when average age was 18 months. Stronger correspondence of AOSI and other scores at this second visit suggests early autism behaviours are better established and more consistent by 18 months of age, even though these infants showed clear enough signs of possible autism to prompt referral to our study around 12 months of age.

Many past studies have described a cognitive profile of autistic individuals characterized by higher nonverbal than verbal IQ scores. The diagnostic utility of this profile, however, remains unknown. We leveraged receiver operating characteristic methods to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of three different IQ profiles in a large sample of children who have an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis (N = 1,228, Simons Simplex Collection) who completed the Differential Ability Scales-Second Edition (DAS-II), School Age compared to the normative sample provided by the DAS-II publisher (N = 2,200). The frequently discussed nonverbal > verbal IQ profile performed near chance at distinguishing ASD from normative individuals (AUC: 0.54, 95% CI [0.52-0.56]), and performed significantly worse for females than males (AUC: females: 0.46 [0.41-0.52]; males: 0.55 [0.53-0.58]).

In an analysis of over 1,000 autistic children, we found that the group's average nonverbal intelligence is usually higher than their verbal intelligence. However, this pattern should not be used by clinicians to make an individual diagnosis of autism because our results show it is not helpful nor accurate.",pubmed,0.5072118004870169

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neighborhood environment factors and PA among children with ASD by examining the extent to which (a) the built environment, (b) neighborhood safety, and (c) neighborhood support contributes to PA. A secondary data analysis using the 2016 and 2017 combined dataset of the National Survey of Children's Health was used. The total sample included 14,944 children between the ages of 6-17 years; of this, a sample of 494 children had a parent-reported diagnosis of ASD. Multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to explore the unique influences of the above three neighborhood environment factors on PA engagement. Among children with and without ASD, an association was found between feeling safe and engaging in PA, that is, the odds of engaging in PA are greater among children who were safe in their neighborhoods than children who were not in safe neighborhoods. Surprisingly, other neighborhood factors do not have a significant relationship with PA participation among children with ASD at this time. Future studies should consider how to incorporate the support of others and feeling of safety into the neighborhood along with how to improve accessibility of the built environment in order to increase PA for children with ASD. LAY SUMMARY: The results of this study showed that neighborhood factors influence physical activity (PA) among children with ASD differently compared to their peers without ASD. Children with ASD who live in safe neighborhoods are more likely to engage in PA, while other neighborhood factors, such as playgrounds and support, are not associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in PA at this time. Efforts should be made to improve neighborhood accessibility and design in order to increase PA among children with ASD.",pubmed,0.5060469786064771

In this work, we propose a novel approach based on complex networks using 1016 T1-weighted MRI brain scans (in the age range 7-64years). We introduce a structural connectivity model of the human brain: MRI scans are divided in rectangular boxes and Pearson's correlation is measured among them in order to obtain a complex network model. Brain connectivity is then characterized through few and easy-to-interpret centrality measures; finally, brain age is predicted by feeding a compact deep neural network. The proposed approach is accurate, robust and computationally efficient, despite the large and heterogeneous dataset used. Age prediction accuracy, in terms of correlation between predicted and actual age r=0.89and Mean Absolute Error MAE =2.19years, compares favorably with results from state-of-the-art approaches. On an independent test set including 262 subjects, whose scans were acquired with different scanners and protocols we found MAE =2.52. The only imaging analysis steps required in the proposed framework are brain extraction and linear registration, hence robust results are obtained with a low computational cost. In addition, the network model provides a novel insight on aging patterns within the brain and specific information about anatomical districts displaying relevant changes with aging.",pubmed,0.504422227209853

The current study aims to adapt and validate the GCOS-24 as an outcome measure in the context routine genetic testing in ASD and related conditions. Families seen for their child's developmental evaluation for ASD and related conditions were invited to participate in a genomics cohort between 2016 and 2018. Families (n = 111) completed the mGCOS-24 (modified GCOS-24), adapted from the original GCOS-24 by clinicians working in the target population's routine care pathway. The mGCOS-24 has acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.84) and high test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.88).

The risk of victimization in students with ASD was significantly higher than that in typically developing students and students with other disabilities. Further, deficits in social interaction and communication, externalizing symptoms, internalizing symptoms, and integrated inclusive school settings were related to higher victimization, and externalizing symptoms were related to higher perpetration.

However, the phenotype of regionally specific increased cortical thickness observed in ASD may be driven by several independent biological processes that influence the gray/white matter boundary, such as synaptic pruning, myelination, or atypical migration. Here, we propose to use the boundary sharpness coefficient (BSC), a proxy for alterations in microstructure at the cortical gray/white matter boundary, to investigate brain differences in individuals with ASD, including factors that may influence ASD-related heterogeneity (age, sex, and intelligence quotient). Using a vertex-based meta-analysis and a large multicenter structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset, with a total of 1136 individuals, 415 with ASD (112 female; 303 male), and 721 controls (283 female; 438 male), we observed that individuals with ASD had significantly greater BSC in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus indicating an abrupt transition (high contrast) between white matter and cortical intensities. Individuals with ASD under 18 had significantly greater BSC in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus and right postcentral gyrus; individuals with ASD over 18 had significantly increased BSC in the bilateral precuneus and superior temporal gyrus. Increases were observed in different brain regions in males and females, with larger effect sizes in females. BSC correlated with ADOS-2 Calibrated Severity Score in individuals with ASD in the right medial temporal pole. Importantly, there was a significant spatial overlap between maps of the effect of diagnosis on BSC when compared with cortical thickness.

To manage this uncertainty, we evaluated the impact of missing values and feature imputation methods on two previously published autism detection classifiers, trained on standard-of-care instrument scoresheets and tested on ratings of 140 children videos from YouTube. We compare the baseline method of listwise deletion to classic univariate and multivariate techniques.

Many studies have demonstrated atypical responses to audiovisual sensory inputs, particularly those containing sociolinguistic information. It is currently unclear whether these atypical responses are due to the linguistic nature of the inputs or the social aspect itself. Further, it is unclear how atypical sensory responses to sociocommunicative stimuli intersect with autism symptomatology. The current study addressed these outstanding questions by using pupillometry in mental age-matched children with and without autism (N = 71) to examine physiological responses to dynamic, audiovisual stimuli including social, sociolinguistic, socioemotional, and nonsocial stimuli, as well as to temporally manipulated stimuli. Data revealed group differences in pupillary responses with social stimuli but not nonsocial stimuli and, importantly, showed no variation through the inclusion of linguistic or emotional information. This suggests that atypical sensory responses are driven primarily by the inclusion of social information broadly. Further, individual responses to social stimuli were significantly correlated with a wide range of autism spectrum disorder symptomatology, including social communication, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, and sensory processing issues. Pupillary responses to social but not nonsocial presentation were also capable of predicting diagnosis with a high level of selectivity, but only with marginal sensitivity. Finally, responses to the temporal manipulation did not yield any group differences, suggesting that while atypical multisensory temporal processing has been well documented in autism at the level of behavior and perception, these issues may be intact at the physiological level.

Using the paradigm of actor-perceiver, where the child was the actor and the robot or the human the perceiver, we recorded the autonomic heart rate activation and reported emotional feelings of ASD children in both countries. Japanese and French ASD children showed different interpersonal synchronisation when they interacted with the human perceiver, even though the human was the same in both countries. However, they exhibited similar interpersonal synchronisation when the perceiver was the robot. The findings suggest that the mechanism combining interpersonal synchronisation and emotional empathy might be weakened but not absent in ASD children and that both French and Japanese ASD children do spontaneously and unconsciously discern non verbal actions of non human partners through a direct matching process that occurs via automatic mapping.",pubmed,0.48853860039727803

Literature showing that individuals with ASD display deficits in ToM is extensive and robust. However, some related issues deserve more research: the heterogeneous profile of ToM abilities in children with ASD and the association between different levels of ToM development and social, pragmatic, and adaptive behaviors in everyday life. The first objective of this study was to identify profiles of children with ASD without intellectual disability (ID), based on explicit and applied ToM knowledge, and compare these profiles with a group of children with typical development (TD). A second objective was to determine differences in symptom severity, adaptive/social behavior, and pragmatic abilities between the profiles identified. Fifty-two children with a clinical diagnosis of ASD without ID and 37 children with TD performed neuropsychological ToM tasks and two vocabulary and memory tests. In addition, all of their mothers completed different questionnaires about applied ToM abilities, severity of ASD symptoms, adaptive/social skills, and pragmatic competence. Two subgroups were identified in the cluster analysis carried out with explicit and applied ToM indicators. The ""Lower ToM abilities"" profile obtained significantly lower scores than the ""Higher ToM abilities"" profile on all the ToM measures. Furthermore, the analysis of covariance, controlling for vocabulary and working memory (ANCOVAs), showed statistically significant differences in applied ToM abilities between the two groups of children with ASD without ID and the group with TD. However, only the group with ""Higher ToM abilities"" achieved similar performance to the TD group on the verbal task of explicit ToM knowledge. Finally, the ""Lower ToM abilities"" cluster obtained significantly higher scores on autism symptoms (social and communication domains) and lower scores on adaptive behavior and pragmatic skills than the cluster with ""Higher ToM abilities.""

Thirty participants with TSC (11-21 years, 20 females, IQ = 35-108) underwent brief (approximately 1 h) daytime actigraph assessment during two settings: movie viewing and cognitive testing. Multiple linear regressions were used to test associations between movement measurements and parent-rated ADHD symptoms. Correlations were used to examine associations between actigraph measures and parent-rated ADHD symptoms and other characteristics of TSC (symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual ability (IQ), epilepsy severity, cortical tuber count). Higher movement levels during movies were associated with higher parent-rated ADHD symptoms. Higher ADHD symptoms and actigraph-measured movement levels during movies were positively associated with ASD symptoms and negatively associated with IQ.

In AJN's May 1958 issue, an article entitled ""Childhood Schizophrenia"" describes the inpatient treatment of children with autism. Some parts of it are difficult to read, not because the actual treatment was painful or torturous, but because experts decided that children needed to be away from their parents in order for treatment to be successful. The authors of this article, a pediatric psychiatrist and a psychiatric nurse educator, write, ""Because the mother's role is so significant in the child's development . . . in almost every instance, the schizophrenic [autistic] child must be removed from its 'sick' mother in order that adequate remedial measures may be instituted.""

They are first biotransformed to the more toxic oxon form, and then hydrolyzed to specific metabolites by the enzyme paraoxonase/arylesterase, encoded by the gene <i>PON1</i> located on human chr. 7q21.3. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a correlation between OP exposure and disease onset has been reported. In this case-control study, we aimed to replicate our previous work showing reduced levels of serum PON1 arylesterase activity in Italian and Caucasian-American ASD samples, and to extend our analysis to other neurodevelopmental disorders, namely ADHD and developmental language disorder (DLD), also known as specific language impairment (SLI). The arylesterase activity, measured using standard spectrophotometric methods, is significantly reduced in the ADHD, and not in the ASD sample compared with the controls. Our previous results seemingly stem from spuriously high arylesterase levels in the former control sample. Finally, genotyping SNPs rs705379 and rs662 using TDI-FP, a significant effect of rs705379 alleles on the serum arylesterase activity is observed in all of the subgroups tested, regardless of diagnosis, as well as a lack of association between <i>PON1</i> gene polymorphisms and ASD/ADHD susceptibility in the Italian population. In summary, the serum arylesterase activity is reduced in children and adolescents with ADHD, and this reduction is not due to the functional <i>PON1</i> gene variants assessed in this study.

Individuals with ASD show an altered selection of motor parameters, resulting in clumsy and fragmented actions. Here, we investigated inter-joint coordination and motor synergies as a potential substrate of motor control problems in ASD. Synergies enable co-controlling redundant motor degrees of freedom (DoF, e.g. joint angles, muscles) by mapping behavioural goals into a flexible and low-dimensional set of variables. This mechanism simplifies motor control and helps to find unambiguous solutions for motor tasks. In a reaching-grasping paradigm, children with ASD showed reduced coupling between DoF, which correlated with socio-communicative symptoms severity. Impaired synergies may help to frame well-established motor problems in ASD, including impaired motor sequencing and abnormal trial-to-trial motor variability. On the other hand, synergies also provide an effective and compact coding system of observed actions. Impaired synergies may thus jeopardize motor interaction by initiating bottom-up cascade effects, leading to pervasive impairments of social behaviour. Finally, we trained an automatic classification algorithm to distinguish between ASD and typically developing (TD) participants based on reaching-grasping kinematics. Classification accuracy reached up to 0.947. This result corroborates and expands previous accounts claiming that motor-based early recognition is feasible and effective in ASD.",pubmed,0.48199550847039796

High throughput sequencing technologies like exome sequencing have become more commonly available and are significantly improving genetic testing. We present two siblings - a 14-year old male and an 8-year old female patient - with a similar clinical phenotype that was characterized by combined developmental delay primarily affecting speech, mild to moderate intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities, and autism spectrum disorder, but with no congenital anomalies. The sister showed additional muscular hypotonia and more pronounced dysmorphic features compared to her brother. Both parents had psychiatric disorders and mild to moderate intellectual disability. A common genetic etiology in the siblings was suspected. Metabolic, psychological and neuroradiological examinations were complemented by basic genetic testing including chromosome analysis and array comparative genomics hybridization analysis (CGH), followed by exome sequencing and combined data analysis of the family. Exome sequencing identified two different underlying genetic conditions: in the sister, a maternally inherited pathogenic variant c.1661C > T, p.Pro554Leu in SLC6A8 (NM_005629.4) was identified causing cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome 1 (MIM #300352) which was confirmed by MR spectroscopy and treated accordingly. In the brother, a paternally inherited 16p13.11 duplication was identified by exome sequencing and considered to be likely associated with his and possibly his father's phenotype. The 16p13.11 duplication had been previously identified in an array CGH but had not been prioritized due to the lack of segregation in the siblings.

The total mean±SD of score obtained for the child abuse risk was 3.18±0.56. Most mothers (87.31%) had moderate to severe level of child abuse risk. Based on multiple linear regression test, education (β=0.161, 95%CI; 0.076-0.247, P =0.001), being an employee (β=0.223, 95%CI; 0.059-0.387, P=0.008), family income (β=0.092, 95% CI; 0.006-0.179, P=0.037), spouse’s education (β=0.128, 95% CI; 0.046-0.209, P=0.002), and addiction status of spouse (β=0.236, 95% CI; 0.006-0.466, P=0.044) were predictors of child abuse risk among the studied variables, respectively.  Conclusion: The results showed that most samples had a moderate risk of child abuse. It reveals the necessity to assess the attitudes of mothers about parenting, which predicts the potential of child abuse to some extent and can provide a basis of educational interventions for mothers to prevent child abuse.</jats:p>",crossref,0.47606890186854944

Our previous work showed gut Immunoglobulin A (IgA) to be significantly elevated in the gut lumen of children with ASD compared to typically developing (TD) children. Gut microbiota variations have been reported in ASD, yet not much is known about virulence factor-related gut microbiota (VFGM) genes. Upon determining the VFGM genes distinguishing ASD from TD, this study is the first to utilize VFGM genes and IgA levels for a machine learning-based classification of ASD. Sequence comparisons were performed of metagenome datasets from children with ASD (<i>n</i> = 43) and TD children (<i>n</i> = 31) against genes in the virulence factor database. VFGM gene composition was associated with ASD phenotype. VFGM gene diversity was higher in children with ASD and positively correlated with IgA content. As Group B streptococcus (GBS) genes account for the highest proportion of 24 different VFGMs between ASD and TD and positively correlate with gut IgA, GBS genes were used in combination with IgA and VFGMs diversity to distinguish ASD from TD. Given that VFGM diversity, increases in IgA, and ASD-enriched VFGM genes were independent of sex and gastrointestinal symptoms, a classification method utilizing them will not pertain only to a specific subgroup of ASD. By introducing the classification value of VFGM genes and considering that VFs can be isolated in pregnant women and newborns, these findings provide a novel machine learning-based early risk identification method for ASD.",pubmed,0.47428735638312564

In this study, we measured individual differences in well-being in 573 six to thirty-year-olds with and without a diagnosis of autism. We investigated whether individual differences in well-being were explained by autism traits (e.g. social-communication difficulties) and/or anxiety and depression symptoms. We showed that, though well-being was lower for some autistic individuals, compared to those without autism, many autistic individuals reported good well-being. Where well-being was reduced, this was particularly explained by depression symptoms, across all ages. For children/adolescents, anxiety and social-communication difficulties were also related to some aspects of well-being. Our study suggests that support and services for improving mental health, especially depression symptoms, may also improve broader outcomes for autistic people.",pubmed,0.4729894401031554

In addition, several correlations between regional 5-HTT availability and social cognitive test performance were found. The results confirm the hypothesis that 5-HTT availability is lower in the brain of adult individuals with ASD, and are consistent with the theory of 5-HT involvement in ASD neurodevelopment.

Groups of LAD, current ASD, and typically developing (TD) participants completed an auditory discrimination task. Individuals with TD showed a bias towards previously perceived stimuli-a perceptual process called ""contraction bias""; that is, their representation of a given tone was contracted towards the preceding trial stimulus in a manner that is Bayesian optimal. Similarly, individuals in the LAD group showed a contraction bias. In contrast, individuals with current ASD showed a weaker contraction bias, suggesting reduced perceptual inferencing. These findings suggest that changes that characterize LAD extend beyond the social and communicative symptoms of ASD, impacting perceptual domains. Measuring perceptual processing earlier in development in ASD will tap the causality between changes in perceptual and symptomatological domains.

These behavioral labels are fed as input to a previously validated binary logistic regression classifier for detecting autism cases using categorical feature vectors. While the metrics do not incorporate any ground truth labels of child diagnosis, linear regression using the 3 correlative metrics as input can predict the mean probability of the correct class of each worker with a mean average error of 7.51% for performance on the same set of videos and 10.93% for performance on a distinct balanced video set with different children. These results indicate that crowd workers can be recruited for performance based largely on behavioral metrics on a crowdsourced task, enabling an affordable way to filter crowd workforces into a trustworthy and reliable diagnostic workforce.",pubmed,0.45076439355936265

With the abrupt shutdown of face-to-face teaching caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a case-based online training program integrating audio and video of real patients was developed. <b>Methods:</b> The blended learning platform CaseTrain guides medical students in their final year through real child-psychiatric patient cases, such as anorexia, autism, or attention deficit disorder, through presentation of video and audio of real patients and parents. The teaching format complements lectures on child psychiatric topics, comprising asynchronous elements (self-study using the digital material) as well as synchronous elements (web-conferences with a specialist). Learning objectives for students were set to develop knowledge of the spectra of psychiatric disorders that affect children and to recognize approaches how to assess and manage common psychiatric problems of childhood and adolescence. <b>Results:</b> The feedback from medical students through oral and written evaluation was positive. They appreciated getting to know 'real-world patients' in times of such a pandemic, to learn explorative techniques from role models, and to be in close contact with the supervising specialist. In consequence of critical feedback on the length of some video sequences, these training units will undergo revision. <b>Conclusions:</b> Case-based online training may continue to be a useful option in a post-pandemic future as integral part of medical education, complementing face-to-face lectures and training in (child) psychiatry.",pubmed,0.45076380023941726

The design process included two focus group discussions with foster carers, programme volunteers, and child development experts. From this, an evaluation survey for children to use was developed. The survey’s underpinning conceptual framework, based on key protective factors influencing educational outcomes for children in out-of-home care, is a key contribution of this research. In addition, the design and implementation issues PJF encountered contribute insights for other nonprofit organisations and evaluators and academic knowledge towards evaluations involving children and vulnerable stakeholders. Hearing children’s views on programmes they are involved in is vital in helping to develop safe spaces for children to engage, where their thoughts are valued and opinions matter.

Clinical,S2213-1582(21)00004-8,,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often involves dysfunction in general motor control and motor coordination, in addition to core symptoms. However, the neural mechanisms underlying motor dysfunction in ASD are poorly understood. To elucidate this issue, we focused on brain oscillations and their coupling in the primary motor cortex (M1). We recorded magnetoencephalography in 18 children with ASD, aged 5 to 7 years, and 19 age- and IQ-matched typically-developing children while they pressed a button during a video-game-like motor task. The motor-related gamma (70 to 90 Hz) and pre-movement beta oscillations (15 to 25 Hz) were analyzed in the primary motor cortex using an inverse method. To determine the coupling between beta and gamma oscillations, we applied phase-amplitude coupling to calculate the statistical dependence between the amplitude of fast oscillations and the phase of slow oscillations. We observed a motor-related gamma increase and a pre-movement beta decrease in both groups. The ASD group exhibited a reduced motor-related gamma increase and enhanced pre-movement beta decrease in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex. We found phase-amplitude coupling, in which high-gamma activity was modulated by the beta rhythm in the primary motor cortex. Phase-amplitude coupling in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex was reduced in the ASD group compared with the control group. Using oscillatory changes and their couplings, linear discriminant analysis classified the ASD and control groups with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 97.1%). The current findings revealed alterations in oscillations and oscillatory coupling, reflecting the dysregulation of motor gating mechanisms in ASD. These results may be helpful for elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying motor dysfunction in ASD, suggesting the possibility of developing a biomarker for ASD diagnosis.",pubmed,0.4293163037004175

Factorial validity was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis. The DASS-21 demonstrated good internal consistency, adequate convergent validity, and all items exhibited satisfactory item-total correlations. Considering fit indices and factor loadings, the confirmatory factor analysis results provided support for the original 3-factor oblique model consisting of depression, anxiety, and stress factors.

Identifying early neural indicators of later cognitive ability may enable us to better elucidate the mechanisms that shape individual differences, eventually aiding identification of infants with an elevated likelihood of less optimal outcomes. A previous study associated a measure of neural activity (theta EEG) recorded at 12-months with non-verbal cognitive ability at ages two, three and seven in individuals with older siblings with autism (Jones et al., 2020). In a pre-registered study (https://osf.io/v5xrw/), we replicate and extend this finding in a younger, low-risk infant sample. EEG was recorded during presentation of a non-social video to a cohort of 6-month-old infants and behavioural data was collected at 6- and 9-months-old. Initial analyses replicated the finding that frontal theta power increases over the course of video viewing, extending this to 6-month-olds. Further, individual differences in the magnitude of this change significantly predicted non-verbal cognitive ability measured at 9-months, but not early executive function. Theta change at 6-months-old may therefore be an early indicator of later cognitive ability.

Here, we propose to probe the validity of the HDC as a psychometric instrument for quantifying social abilities in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurotypical development. To study interpersonal synchrony with the HDC, we derived five standardized scores following a gradient from sensorimotor and motor to higher sociocognitive skills in a sample of 155 individuals (113 participants with ASD, 42 typically developing participants; aged 5 to 25 years; IQ > 70). Regression analyses were performed using normative modeling on global scores according to four subconditions (HDC behavior ""cooperative/competitive,"" human task ""in-phase/anti-phase,"" diagnosis, and age at inclusion). Children with ASD had lower scores than controls for motor skills. HDC motor coordination scores were the best candidates for stratification and diagnostic biomarkers according to exploratory analyses of hierarchical clustering and multivariate classification. Independently of phenotype, sociocognitive skills increased with developmental age while being affected by the ongoing task and HDC behavior. Weaker performance in ASD for motor skills suggests the convergent validity of the HDC for evaluating social interaction. Results provided additional evidence of a relationship between sensorimotor and sociocognitive skills. HDC may also be used as a marker of maturation of sociocognitive skills during real-time social interaction. Through its standardized and objective evaluation, the HDC not only represents a valid paradigm for the study of interpersonal synchrony but also offers a promising, clinically relevant psychometric instrument for the evaluation and stratification of sociomotor dysfunctions.",pubmed,0.4255373675757685

This group also commonly presents with challenging behaviours (e.g. aggression and self-injury) with debate about whether these behaviours should be considered 'depressive equivalents' or are sensitive for, but not specific to, depression in severe-profound ID. We conducted a systematic review exploring behaviours associated with depression and low mood in individuals with severe-profound ID. The review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (2009) guidelines. Three electronic databases were searched (Embase, PsycINFO and Ovid MEDLINE), and 13 studies were included and rated for quality. Few studies were rated as having high methodological quality. Behaviours captured by standard diagnostic schemes for depression (e.g. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and International Classification of Diseases) showed a relationship with depression in severe-profound ID, including the two core symptoms (depressed affect and anhedonia), as well as irritability, sleep disturbance, psychomotor agitation, reduced appetite and fatigue. Challenging behaviours such as aggression, self-injury, temper tantrums, screaming and disruptive behaviour were associated with depression. Challenging behaviours show a robust relationship with depression. Whilst these behaviours may suggest an underlying depression, study limitations warrant caution in labelling them as 'depressive equivalents'. These limitations include not controlling for potential confounds (autism, other affective disorders and pain) and bias associated with comparing depressed/non-depressed groups on the same behavioural criteria used to initially diagnose and separate these groups. Future studies that use depressive measures designed for ID populations, which control for confounds and which explore low mood irrespective of psychiatric diagnosis, are warranted to better delineate the behaviours associated with depression in this population (PROSPERO 2018: CRD42018103244).",pubmed,0.4236513199498615

Inscapes, a non-social and non-verbal movie paradigm, has been introduced to increase attention, thus mitigating head motion, while reducing the task-induced activations found during typical movie watching. Inscapes has not yet been validated for use in magnetoencephalography (MEG), and it has yet to be shown whether its effects are stable in clinical populations. Across typically developing (N = 32) children and adolescents and those with ASD (N = 46) and ADHD (N = 42), we demonstrate that head motion is reduced during Inscapes. Due to the task state evoked by movie paradigms, we also expectedly observed concomitant modulations in local neural activity (oscillatory power) and functional connectivity (phase and envelope coupling) in intrinsic resting-state networks and across the frequency spectra compared to a fixation cross resting-state. Increases in local activity were accompanied by decreases in low-frequency connectivity within and between resting-state networks, primarily the visual network, suggesting that task-state evoked by Inscapes moderates ongoing and spontaneous cortical inhibition that forms the idling intrinsic networks found during a fixation cross resting-state. Importantly, these effects were similar in ASD and ADHD, making Inscapes a well-suited advancement for investigations of resting brain function in young and clinical populations.",pubmed,0.42086775902198986

Similarity of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations during rsfMRI between brain regions is thought to reflect intrinsic functional connectivity (FC), potentially due to history of coactivation. To quantify similarity, studies have almost exclusively relied on Pearson correlation, which assumes linearity and can therefore underestimate FC if the hemodynamic response function differs regionally or there is BOLD signal lag between timeseries. Here we show in three cohorts of children, adolescents and adults, with and without autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), that measuring the similarity of BOLD signal fluctuations using non-linear dynamic time warping (DTW) is more robust to global signal regression (GSR), has higher test-retest reliability and is more sensitive to task-related changes in FC. Additionally, when comparing FC between individuals with ASDs and typical controls, more group differences are detected using DTW. DTW estimates are also more related to ASD symptom severity and executive function, while Pearson correlation estimates of FC are more strongly associated with respiration during rsfMRI. Together these findings suggest that non-linear methods such as DTW improve estimation of resting state FC, particularly when studying clinical populations whose hemodynamics or neurovascular coupling may be altered compared to typical controls.",pubmed,0.4144895133893057

Family navigation services are designed to improve access to care. While these services are a promising intervention to enhance well-being and developmental outcomes, there are limited tools that can systematically facilitate the development of a shared navigation plan that prioritizes the concerns of the family. The Family-Centered Autism Navigation semi-structured interview guide is designed for family navigators to triage and prioritize caregiver's needs to coordinate and navigate systems of care after learning of their child's autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. The goals of the Family-Centered Autism Navigation interview are to (1) identify family and child strengths; (2) identify family/caregiver concerns regarding navigation of services and systems following their child's diagnosis of autism; (3) measure change in caregiver knowledge, ability and skill as it relates to understanding, remembering, and evaluating information they receive; and (4) assist with the development of a shared navigation plan.

We found no common characteristics (such as severity of autism symptoms) that best describe autistic youth who experience problems with feeding or eating. Almost all studies we reviewed focused on problems with feeding (selective or picky eating), and only a few studies focused on eating disorder symptoms (concern with weight, shape, and/or body image). However, some researchers reported that eating disorder symptoms may occur more often in autistic individuals compared to their peers without autism. Many studies used the terms ""feeding"" and ""eating"" problems interchangeably, but understanding the difference between these problems is important for researchers to be consistent, as well as for proper identification and treatment. We suggest future researchers use ""eating problems"" when behaviors involve preoccupation with food, eating, or body image, and ""feeding problems"" when this preoccupation is absent. We highlight the importance of understanding whether feeding or eating problems are separate from autism traits, and the role of caregivers and other adults in the child's treatment.

Relationships between sensory symptoms and age, sex, ASD, IQ, and adaptive behavior were examined. Genotype-phenotype correlations with the recurrent p.Tyr719* variant were also explored. <i>Results:</i> Sensory reactivity symptoms were observed and reported in all participants. A syndrome-specific phenotype was identified, characterized by high levels of sensory seeking across tactile, auditory, and visual domains. Tactile hyporeactivity, characterized by pain insensitivity, was reported in the majority of participants. Sensory symptoms were identified across individuals regardless of age, sex, IQ, adaptive ability, genetic variant, and most importantly, ASD status. No significant differences were identified between participants with and without the recurrent p.Tyr719* variant on any sensory measure. <i>Conclusions:</i> Sensory reactivity symptoms are a common clinical feature of ADNP syndrome. Quantifying sensory reactivity using existing standardized measures will enhance understanding of sensory reactivity in individuals with ADNP syndrome and will aid in clinical care.

To further understand the relationship between aberrant immune responses and dysbiotic features of the gut microbiome in ASD, we enrolled 45 ASD individuals and 41 healthy control subjects with ages ranging from 2 to 19 years. We found that ASD group subjects have significantly higher plasma levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, TNF-β, and IFN-γ when compared to healthy controls (FDR-adjusted <i>p</i> < 0.05). The plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-6 are found to be further associated with several largely pathogenic gut microbiota uniquely detected in subjects with ASD. Furthermore, the ASD gut microbiome is characterized by reduced levels of several beneficial microbiota, including <i>Bacteroides</i> (FDR-adjusted <i>p</i> < 0.01) and Lachnospiraceae (FDR-adjusted <i>p</i> < 0.001). Analysis of Lachnospiraceae family and genus level taxa suggested that relative abundances of such taxa are negatively correlated with pro-inflammatory signaling cytokines IFN-γ and IL-6, particularly in subjects with severe ASD as defined by CARS (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Several largely pathogenic genera are determined to be associated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-6 (FDR-adjusted <i>p</i> < 0.1). Additionally, IL-4 is significantly negatively correlated with CARS total score (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Based on such results, we propose that the association between the disturbances of specific cytokines and alterations in gut microbiota abundance observed in children and adolescents with ASD provides additional evidence on the induction of aberrant pro-inflammatory mechanisms in ASD and its early diagnosis.",pubmed,0.3907948679036904

The molecular abnormality underlying <i>FMR1</i> silencing, CGG repeat expansion, is well characterized; however, delineation of the pathway from DNA to RNA to protein using biosamples from well characterized patients with FXS is limited. Since FXS is a common and prototypical genetic disorder associated with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a comprehensive assessment of the <i>FMR1</i> DNA-RNA-protein pathway and its correlations with the neurobehavioral phenotype is a priority. We applied nine sensitive and quantitative assays evaluating <i>FMR1</i> DNA, RNA, and FMRP parameters to a reference set of cell lines representing the range of <i>FMR1</i> expansions. We then used the most informative of these assays on blood and buccal specimens from cohorts of patients with different <i>FMR1</i> expansions, with emphasis on those with FXS (N = 42 total, N = 31 with FMRP measurements). The group with FMRP data was also evaluated comprehensively in terms of its neurobehavioral profile, which allowed molecular-neurobehavioral correlations. <i>FMR1</i> CGG repeat expansions, methylation levels, and FMRP levels, in both cell lines and blood samples, were consistent with findings of previous <i>FMR1</i> genomic and protein studies. They also demonstrated a high level of agreement between blood and buccal specimens. These assays further corroborated previous reports of the relatively high prevalence of methylation mosaicism (slightly over 50% of the samples). Molecular-neurobehavioral correlations confirmed the inverse relationship between overall severity of the FXS phenotype and decrease in FMRP levels (N = 26 males, mean 4.2 ± 3.3 pg FMRP/ng genomic DNA). Other intriguing findings included a significant relationship between the diagnosis of FXS with ASD and two-fold lower levels of FMRP (mean 2.8 ± 1.3 pg FMRP/ng genomic DNA, <i>p</i> = 0.04), in particular observed in younger age- and IQ-adjusted males (mean age 6.9 ± 0.9 years with mean 3.2 ± 1.2 pg FMRP/ng genomic DNA, 57% with severe ASD), compared to FXS without ASD. Those with severe ID had even lower FMRP levels independent of ASD status in the male-only subset. The results underscore the link between <i>FMR1</i> expansion, gene methylation, and FMRP deficit. The association between FMRP deficiency and overall severity of the neurobehavioral phenotype invites follow up studies in larger patient cohorts. They would be valuable to confirm and potentially extend our initial findings of the relationship between ASD and other neurobehavioral features and the magnitude of FMRP deficit. Molecular profiling of individuals with FXS may have important implications in research and clinical practice.",pubmed,0.3896340039497987

Deleterious variants in NCKAP1 have been identified in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability; however, its clinical significance remains unclear. To determine its significance, we assemble genotype and phenotype data for 21 affected individuals from 20 unrelated families with predicted deleterious variants in NCKAP1. This includes 16 individuals with de novo (n = 8), transmitted (n = 6), or inheritance unknown (n = 2) truncating variants, two individuals with structural variants, and three with potentially disruptive de novo missense variants. We report a de novo and ultra-rare deleterious variant burden of NCKAP1 in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders which needs further replication. ASD or autistic features, language and motor delay, and variable expression of intellectual or learning disability are common clinical features. Among inherited cases, there is evidence of deleterious variants segregating with neuropsychiatric disorders. Based on available human brain transcriptomic data, we show that NCKAP1 is broadly and highly expressed in both prenatal and postnatal periods and demostrate enriched expression in excitatory neurons and radial glias but depleted expression in inhibitory neurons. Mouse in utero electroporation experiments reveal that Nckap1 loss of function promotes neuronal migration during early cortical development. Combined, these data support a role for disruptive NCKAP1 variants in neurodevelopmental delay/autism, possibly by interfering with neuronal migration early in cortical development.",pubmed,0.3850669161576588

Parents of 218 young people (41% with a primary diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder) with a diverse representation of disabilities completed an online survey. Young people were categorized as either participants in OPA (<i>n</i> = 131) or non-participants (<i>n</i> = 87) by parent report. Non-participation was significantly predicted by the barrier ""there are no activities my child enjoys"" and by a lack of children's motivation and happiness during OPA. Significant internal assets differentiating participants from non-participants were the ability to understand simple instructions, love of sport, and meeting physical activity guidelines. Significant external assets were parent and sibling participation in OPA, school type, and household income. The findings from this study have important implications for the design of public health interventions that aim to promote OPA in young people with disabilities, highlighting the need to make activities enjoyable, promote participation of siblings and parents, and support low-income families to participate.",pubmed,0.3834682818235189

The incidence of striatal degeneration in Cohorts I, II, and III was 7%, 47%, and 90%, respectively (p < .0001). No neurologic injuries occurred after 19 months of age. Among uninjured children followed prospectively from birth (Cohort I), measures of growth, nutritional sufficiency, motor development, and cognitive function were normal. Adherence to metabolic formula and l-carnitine supplementation in Cohort I declined to 12% and 32%, respectively, by age 7 years. Cessation of strict dietary therapy altered plasma amino acid and carnitine concentrations but resulted in no serious adverse outcomes. In conclusion, neonatal diagnosis of GA1 coupled to management with lysine-free, arginine-enriched metabolic formula and emergency IV infusions during the first two years of life is safe and effective, preventing more than 90% of striatal injuries while supporting normal growth and psychomotor development.

We investigated the relationship between participants' dysregulation levels and microstructural property of 76 WM tracts in a multivariate analysis (canonical correlation analysis), across diagnostic groups. A single mode of brain-behavior co-variation was identified: participants were spread along a single axis linking diagnosis, dysregulation, diagnosis-by-dysregulation interaction, and intelligence to a specific WM property pattern. This mode corresponds to diagnosis-distinct correlates underpinning dysregulation, which showed higher generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) associated with less dysregulation in ASD but greater dysregulation in TDC, in the tracts connecting limbic and emotion regulation systems. Moreover, higher GFA of the tracts implicated in memory, attention, sensorimotor processing, and perception associated with less dysregulation in TDC but worse dysregulation in ASD.

In this study, we evaluate the capability and potential of a crowd of virtual workers-defined as vetted members of popular crowdsourcing platforms-to aid in the task of diagnosing autism. We evaluate workers when crowdsourcing the task of providing categorical ordinal behavioral ratings to unstructured public YouTube videos of children with autism and neurotypical controls. To evaluate emerging patterns that are consistent across independent crowds, we target workers from distinct geographic loci on two crowdsourcing platforms: an international group of workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) (N = 15) and Microworkers from Bangladesh (N = 56), Kenya (N = 23), and the Philippines (N = 25). We feed worker responses as input to a validated diagnostic machine learning classifier trained on clinician-filled electronic health records. We find that regardless of crowd platform or targeted country, workers vary in the average confidence of the correct diagnosis predicted by the classifier. The best worker responses produce a mean probability of the correct class above 80% and over one standard deviation above 50%, accuracy and variability on par with experts according to prior studies. There is a weak correlation between mean time spent on task and mean performance (<i>r</i> = 0.358, <i>p</i> = 0.005). These results demonstrate that while the crowd can produce accurate diagnoses, there are intrinsic differences in crowdworker ability to rate behavioral features. We propose a novel strategy for recruitment of crowdsourced workers to ensure high quality diagnostic evaluations of autism, and potentially many other pediatric behavioral health conditions.

Despite this, however, there remains a dearth of studies examining the impact of stimulant treatment on CI as well as associated higher order (e.g., working memory [WM]) and perceptual (e.g., time perception) cognitive processes. The present study examines the effect of osmotic release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) on CI, WM and time perception processes as well as the relation among these processes before and after taking a regimen of OROS-MPH. Thirty-five children (aged 7-12 years) with a diagnosis of ADHD participating in a concurrent stimulant medication study were recruited to complete computerized assessments of CI, WM, and time perception. Children completed the assessments after administration of a placebo as well as their lowest effective dose of OROS-MPH following a 2-week titration period. The results from one-sample t-tests indicated that OROS-MPH improves both CI and WM in youth with ADHD but does not impact time perception. Further, results revealed no significant association among the various indices of cognitive performance while taking placebo or OROS-MPH. Overall, the findings suggest that while OROS-MPH improves both CI and WM in youth with ADHD, improvements in CI as a result of OROS-MPH are unlikely to be associated with the improvements in WM given the lack of association among the two. Future studies should consider alternate cognitive, emotional, and motivational mechanisms that may account for the impact of OROS-MPH on CI.

That is, they show over-responsivity in the face of entirely typical sound, light, touch, taste, or smell inputs, and this occurs to such an extent that it interferes with their daily functioning and reaches clinical levels of dysfunction. What marks these individuals apart is that this sensory processing disorder (SPD) is observed in the absence of other symptom clusters that would result in a diagnosis of Autism, ADHD, or other neurodevelopmental disorders more typically associated with sensory processing difficulties. One major theory forwarded to account for these SPDs posits a deficit in multisensory integration, such that the various sensory inputs are not appropriately integrated into the central nervous system, leading to an overwhelming sensory-perceptual environment, and in turn to the sensory-defensive phenotype observed in these individuals. <b>Methods</b>: We tested whether children (6-16 years) with an over-responsive SPD phenotype (<i>N</i> = 12) integrated multisensory speech differently from age-matched typically-developing controls (TD: <i>N</i> = 12). Participants identified monosyllabic words while background noise level and sensory modality (auditory-alone, visual-alone, audiovisual) were varied in pseudorandom order. Improved word identification when speech was both seen and heard compared to when it was simply heard served to index multisensory speech integration. <b>Results</b>: School-aged children with an SPD show a deficit in the ability to benefit from the combination of both seen and heard speech inputs under noisy environmental conditions, suggesting that these children do not benefit from multisensory integrative processing to the same extent as their typically developing peers. In contrast, auditory-alone performance did not differ between the groups, signifying that this multisensory deficit is not simply due to impaired processing of auditory speech. <b>Conclusions</b>: Children with an over-responsive SPD show a substantial reduction in their ability to benefit from complementary audiovisual speech, to enhance speech perception in a noisy environment. This has clear implications for performance in the classroom and other learning environments. Impaired multisensory integration may contribute to sensory over-reactivity that is the definitional of SPD.",pubmed,0.3687966326088437

Aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate patients admitted to the ED for “exacerbated COPD” to describe their clinical heterogeneity and the influence that it may have on outcomes: death, length of hospitalization, exacerbation recurrence. The following data were recorded: history, symptoms, blood gas analysis, laboratory and radiological findings and comorbidities. Each patient underwent electrocardiography, echocardiography and spirometry. In order to identify a correlation between these variables and the selected outcomes, a multivariate linear logistic regression analysis was carried out. This study was conducted on 41 eligible patients consecutively admitted to the emergency room for exacerbated COPD. A consistent proportion showed ECG, Echocardiographic and laboratory abnormalities. At spirometry a FEV1 &lt;30% of predicted was detected in 37% of patients. Cardiovascular comorbidities came out to be very frequent (hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease in particular). The history of heart failure was related to the risk of re-hospitalization within three months, while pneumonia, a low pH and a low FEV1 predicted a hospital stay &gt;7 days.

As a vital element in the formation of a positive body image, the role of the family in childhood has been highlighted by a few studies. This study aimed to assess whether children’s body dissatisfaction could be predicted by their parents’ body dissatisfaction, body mass index (BMI), and approach to change. The sample consisted of 581 participants (366 parents and 215 children). The following instruments were used: anthropometric data, the Brief Scale of Body Dissatisfaction for Children, the IMAGE questionnaire (approach to change and drive for muscularity subscales), and the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness subscales). The results indicated that 19% of children, 22.8% of mothers, and 70.2% of fathers were overweight or obese. The multiple regression models developed for boys and girls explained 60 and 57% of the variance in body dissatisfaction, respectively. Several variables attributable to the mother (higher approach to change, higher drive for thinness, and higher BMI) and to the boys themselves (drive for muscularity, approach to change, and having a high BMI percentile) predicted a higher level of body dissatisfaction. For girls, only variables regarding themselves (approach to change, age, and BMI percentile) explained their body dissatisfaction. Relationships with the traits of the father were not detected for both models. The influence of sociocultural factors on the construction of gender and the negative consequences of mothers’ dieting for aesthetic purposes, on the development of children’s body image, are discussed.</jats:p>",crossref,0.3553706385247943

Previous catatonia conceptualizations were significantly modified in the newest classification systems. Catatonia may be considered either a separate syndrome or a specifier of the course of other psychiatric disorders. Although diagnostic criteria for children and adolescent do not differ from those for adults, the clinical presentation and course may not be the same. In this age group relatively common are somatic conditions taking the form of catatonia. There is agrowing body of literature focused on catatonia in the course of pervasive developmental disorder. On the other hand, pervasive refusal syndrome and lethal catatonia are discussed in the literature, but they are not present in the classification systems. In the current paper basic treatment guidelines were also described. First-line treatment is the use of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy. The diagnosis and treatmentof catatonia is of great practical importance.

The prevalence, type, and presentation vary depending age and other factors. Objectives: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of arrhythmias and associated factors in children with CHD in King Fahad Hospital, Al Baha, Saudi Arabia. Methods: This was a hospital-based retrospective cross- sectional study conducted from January 2010 to December 2020. In total, 185 patients, aged 1 day to 14 years, were included. Children with arrhythmias and CHD were included, while those without CHD were excluded. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16.0. Results: Arrhythmias were confirmed in 46 patients (24.86%), while 139 patients (75.14%) had no electrocardiographic abnormalities, 95 % CI (14.12–21.22). Among the arrhythmias, we found that first-degree atrio-ventricular block was the most common and reported in 30 patients (16.21%); atrial tachyarrhythmias in 5 patients (2.7 %); premature ventricular contractions in 4 patients (2.16%); premature atrial contractions in 3 patients (1.62%); sinus bradycardia in 2 patients (1.1%); complete heart block in 1 patient and a prolonged QT interval with severe hypokalemia, ((0.54%) for each. Conclusion: Arrhythmias are common in children with CHD, and early diagnosis and regular follow-up have significant benefits in management. Cardiac surgery, heart failure, digoxin, and electrolyte disturbances were confirmed as risk factors. Article</jats:p>",crossref,0.35302622817098916

	  <jats:p>Polysemy, or the property of words having multiple meanings, is a prevalent feature of vocabulary. In this study we validated a new measure of polysemy knowledge for children with English as an additional language (EAL) and a first language (EL1) and examined the relationship between polysemy knowledge and age, language status, and reading comprehension. Participants were 112 British children aged 5 to 6 (n = 61) or 8 to 9 years (n = 51), 37% of whom had EAL (n = 41). Participants completed the new measure of knowledge of polysemes, along with other measures of language, literacy and cognitive ability. The new measure was reliable and valid with EAL and EL1 children. Age and language status predicted children's polyseme knowledge. Polyseme knowledge uniquely contributed to reading comprehension after controlling for age, language status, non-verbal intelligence, time reading in English, and breadth of vocabulary. This research underscores the importance of polysemy for children's linguistic development.</jats:p>",crossref,0.345706718674673

Studying this population may provide insight on the pathophysiological underpinnings of this condition. This study aimed to (i) ascertain the presence and autistic symptom load in TPL infants aged age 30 months relative to non-TPL infants, regardless of preterm birth; (ii) explore the association between early (at 6 months) psychomotor development and temperament features with the autistic symptom load of TPL infants at age 30 months and (iii) examine the association among perinatal risk factors for ASD development with the autistic symptom load of TPL infants at age 30 months. A group of 111 mother-infant pairs recruited at TPL diagnosis and a group of 47 healthy mother-infant controls completed the follow-up. Irrespective of preterm birth, TPL infants showed higher autistic symptom load at age 30 months than non-TPL infants. TPL infants presented poorer communication and problem-solving skills, reduced smiling and laughter, and greater vocal reactivity at age 6 months, predicting higher autistic symptom load at age 30 months. Higher levels of anxiety symptoms in TPL mothers after a TPL diagnosis also predicted higher autistic symptom load for the infants at age 30 months. These results suggest that TPL infants may be an undescribed cluster, with features that differentiate them from other ""at-risk"" populations. These findings support the need for routine assessment of TPL infants and screening of anxiety symptoms in mothers.",pubmed,0.34383121492291635

Cognitive remediation (CR) associated with psychosocial rehabilitation shows good functional outcomes, with a high level of satisfaction in participants provided by tailored CR. However, few studies looked at the long-term outcome in participants who experienced such a program. This retrospective survey examines the outcome of persons having psychiatric diseases 2 to 9 years after being treated with a personalized CR program. The survey included 12 domains with questions relevant to work, studies, before CR (T1) and at the moment of the survey (T2), questions about housing, relatedness, familiar relationships and daily activities at T2. Finally, a narrative interview was included to express feelings of the participants about CR. Sixty-six participants completed the survey, and were treated with neurocognitive or social cognition programs. Their diagnosis was: schizophrenia (80.3%), neurodevelopment disorder (autism as well as genetic or metabolic disease with psychiatric expression) (15.2%) and bipolar disorder (4.5%). The comparison between T1 and T2 showed significant difference for job employment (P < 0.001), even for competitive jobs (p < 0.007), for performing studies (p = 0.033), for practicing a physical activity (0.033) or reading (0.002). Outcome was also examined in reference to the delay from CR to highlight changes in patient characteristics and service delivery over the years. Hence, the total sample was split in two subgroups: CR delivered in 2009-2013 (n = 37); CR delivered in 2014-2016 (n = 29). While in the former group more participants were working (p = 0.037), in the latter group, which was younger (p = 0.04), more participants were studying (p = 0.02). At T2, a majority of persons experienced no relapse, three years (79.1%) to 8 years (56.8%) after CR, when referring to the anamnesis. Concerning subjective perception of CR, participants expressed feelings concerning positive impact on clarity of thought, on cognitive functions, self-confidence, perceiving CR as an efficient help for work and studies. To conclude, even long years after a personalized CR program, good benefits in terms of employment or studies emerge when compared to the status before CR, with good determinants for recovery in terms of leisure or physical activity practice.",pubmed,0.34256590528051417

A challenge to establishing such markers may be individual differences in developmental course. The present study examined auditory cortex activity in children at an age when developmental changes to the auditory cortex 50 ms (M50) and 100 ms (M100) components are prominent to better understand the use of auditory markers in pediatric clinical research. MEG auditory encoding measures (auditory evoked fields in response to pure tone stimuli) were obtained from 15 typically developing children 6-8 years old, with measures repeated 18 and 36 months after the initial exam. MEG analyses were conducted in source space (i.e., brain location), with M50 and M100 sources identified in left and right primary/secondary auditory cortex (Heschl's gyrus). A left and right M50 response was observed at all times (Time 1, Time 2, Time 3), with M50 latency (collapsing across hemisphere) at Time 3 (77 ms) 10 ms earlier than Time 1 (87 ms; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and with M50 responses on average (collapsing across time) 5 ms earlier in the right (80 ms) than left hemisphere (85 ms; <i>p</i> < 0.05). In the majority of children, however, M50 latency changes were not constant across the three-year period; for example, whereas in some children a ~10 ms latency reduction was observed from Time 1 to Time 2, in other children a ~10 ms latency reduction was observed from Time 2 to Time 3. M100 responses were defined by a significant ""peak"" of detected power with magnetic field topography opposite M50 and occurring 50-100 ms later than the M50. Although M100s were observed in a few children at Time 1 and Time 2 (and more often in the right than left hemisphere), M100s were not observed in the majority of children except in the right hemisphere at Time 3. In sum, longitudinal findings showed large between- and within-subject variability in rate of change as well as time to reach neural developmental milestones (e.g., presence of a detectable M100 response). Findings also demonstrated the need to examine whole-brain activity, given hemisphere differences in the rate of auditory cortex maturation. Pediatric research will need to take such normal variability into account when seeking clinical auditory markers.",pubmed,0.3370333842117487

Eighty percent of children with a neurodevelopmental diagnosis had completed all seasons of Auskick, compared with 93% of children without a neurodevelopmental diagnosis. Results indicated that children with neurodevelopmental disorders (<i>n</i> = 135) were 3.71 times less likely to complete a football season than their typically developing peers (<i>n</i> = 903). Higher levels of involvement during football sessions and greater preference for football were linked to a higher football season completion rate, irrespective of neurodevelopmental disability diagnosis.

Due to its extreme rarity and wide range of clinical severity, clinical suspicion is difficult for a physician. In the current study, its frequency among the Korean pediatric patients with developmental delay (DD) or intellectual disability (ID) was assessed. As the first report of Korean patients with SYS, our study aims to increase the awareness of this condition among the physicians taking care of the pediatric patients with DD/ID and hypotonia.The patients diagnosed with SYS by whole-exome sequencing (WES) among the 460 Korean pediatric patients with DD/ID were included, and their clinical and molecular features were reviewed.Four patients (0.9%) were diagnosed with SYS. Profound DD (4 patients), multiple anomalies including joint contractures and facial dysmorphism (4 patients), generalized hypotonia (3 patients), and severe respiratory difficulty requiring mechanical ventilation (3 patients) were noted in most cases, similar to those in previous reports. Sleep apnea (2 patients), autistic features (2 patients), a high grade of gastroesophageal reflux (1 patient), and seizures (1 patient) were found as well. A total of 3 different truncating MAGEL2 mutations were identified. A previously-reported mutation, to be the most common one, c.1996dupC, was found in 2 patients. The other 2 mutations, c.2217delC and c.3449_3450delTT were novel mutations. As MAGEL2 is maternally imprinted, 2 patients had inherited the MAGEL2 mutation from their respective healthy fathers.SYS is an extremely rare cause of DD/ID. However, hypotonia, joint contractures, profound DD/ID and facial dysmorphism are the suggestive clinical features for SYS. As a maternally imprinted disorder, it should be reminded that SYS may be inherited in form of a mutation from a healthy father.",pubmed,0.32733653918420513

The results suggested that both the interclass and intraclass dissimilarities were related to the model accuracy since they indicate how easy a model can learn discriminative information from the input data. The highest ratios between the average interclass and intraclass dissimilarities were related to the most accurate classifiers.

Acquiring useful information and chief features from this data is challenging, and it has become a prime area of current research. Another crucial area is knowledge inferencing. Much research has been carried out in both directions. Swarm intelligence is used for feature selection whereas for knowledge inferencing either fuzzy or rough computing is widely used. Hybridization of intelligent and swarm intelligence techniques are booming recently. In this research work, the authors hybridize both artificial bee colony and rough set. At the initial phase, they employ an artificial bee colony to find the chief features. Further, these main features are analyzed using rough set generating rules. The proposed model indeed helps to diagnose a disease carefully. An empirical analysis is carried out on hepatitis dataset. In addition, a comparative study is also presented. The analysis shows the viability of the proposed model.</jats:p>",crossref,0.31852286320634277

HVDAS is caused by mutations in activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP). A recent study identified genome-wide DNA methylation changes in 22 individuals with HVDAS, adding to the group of neurodevelopmental disorders with an epigenetic signature. This methylation signature segregated those with HVDAS into two groups based on the location of the mutations. Here, we conducted an independent study on 24 individuals with HVDAS and replicated the existence of the two mutation-dependent episignatures. To probe whether the two distinct episignatures correlate with clinical outcomes, we used deep behavioral and neurobiological data from two prospective cohorts of individuals with a genetic diagnosis of HVDAS. We found limited phenotypic differences between the two HVDAS-affected groups and no evidence that individuals with more widespread methylation changes are more severely affected. Moreover, in spite of the methylation changes, we observed no profound alterations in the blood transcriptome of individuals with HVDAS. Our data warrant caution in harnessing methylation signatures in HVDAS as a tool for clinical stratification, at least with regard to behavioral phenotypes.",pubmed,0.3057042744137652

In this study, we aim to investigate the potential mechanisms through a maternal diabetes-induced autistic mouse model. We found that maternal diabetes-induced autistic offspring have epigenetic changes on the superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) promoter with subsequent SOD2 suppression in both hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Bone marrow transplantation of normal HSC to maternal diabetes-induced autistic offspring transferred epigenetic modifications to PBMC and significantly reversed SOD2 suppression and oxidative stress and elevated inflammatory cytokine levels. Further, <i>in vivo</i> human study showed that SOD2 mRNA expression from PBMC in the ASD group was reduced to ~12% compared to typically developing group, and the SOD2 mRNA level-based ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve shows a very high sensitivity and specificity for ASD patients. We conclude that maternal diabetes induces immune dysfunction in autistic offspring through SOD2 suppression and oxidative stress in HSC.

Previous neuroimaging studies examining the neuroanatomical underpinnings of 22q11.2DS show alterations in cortical volume (CV), cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA). The aim of this study was to identify (1) the spatially distributed networks of differences in CT and SA in 22q11.2DS compared to controls, (2) their unique and spatial overlap, as well as (3) their relative contribution to observed differences in CV. Structural MRI scans were obtained from 62 individuals with 22q11.2DS and 57 age-and-gender-matched controls (aged 6-31). Using FreeSurfer, we examined differences in vertex-wise estimates of CV, CT and SA at each vertex, and compared the frequencies of vertices with a unique or overlapping difference for each morphometric feature. Our findings indicate that CT and SA make both common and unique contributions to volumetric differences in 22q11.2DS, and in some areas, their strong opposite effects mask differences in CV. By identifying the neuroanatomic variability in 22q11.2DS, and the separate contributions of CT and SA, we can start exploring the shared and distinct mechanisms that mediate neuropsychiatric symptoms across disorders, e.g. 22q11.2DS-related ASD and/or psychosis/schizophrenia.",pubmed,0.283558928306425

Unfortunately, these consequences often do not function as reinforcers for behavior in children with autism. Accordingly, the repertoire of BiN is also often limited in these children. Previous research has suggested that so-called multiple-exemplar instruction, a rotation between different speaker and listener operants, may be necessary to establish BiN. The present experiment aimed to investigate whether sequential operant instruction might also work as a successful intervention to improve BiN skills after the establishment of standard social reinforcers. Standard social reinforcers were identified and established through an operant-discrimination training procedure in 4 participating children with an autism spectrum diagnosis. In the present experiment, all participants showed increased BiN after sequential operant instruction with conditioned social reinforcers contingent on relevant operants. Two of 4 participants acquired BiN skills. Moreover, the remaining 2 participants scored within the mastery criterion on listener responses, and 1 of them also met the criterion on the tact probes. Essential characteristics of an intervention, as well as the role of the echoic in the emission of BiN, are discussed.",pubmed,0.2831842132699345

Epileptic spasms can have devastating consequences on the development of individuals with the condition. This review sought to explore the lifetime prevalence and underlying mechanism of epileptic spasms in this population. We also aimed to review the response rate to various treatments, the relapse rate, and the development of subsequent epilepsy or autism in this population. A comprehensive literature search was conducted for articles discussing the lifetime prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, outcomes, or underlying etiology of epileptic spasms in animal models or individuals with DS. According to available literature, the global clinic-based lifetime prevalence of epilepsy in individuals with DS ranged from 1.6% to 23.1%, with epileptic spasms representing 6.7%-66.7% of these cases. Response rate to treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone/corticosteroids was highest (81%) and has the most literature supporting its use, with other regimens, including vigabatrin and other antiepileptic drugs, having lower response rates. Epileptic spasms occur more frequently in children with DS than in the general population, though more studies are needed to determine the true lifetime prevalence of epileptic spasms in this population. Generally, children with DS and epileptic spasms tend to be more responsive to treatment and have better outcomes than children with epileptic spasms of unknown etiology (ie, without DS), in terms of response and relapse rates as well as the development of intractable epilepsy (eg, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome).",pubmed,0.2742703359726253

This suggests that E:I imbalance may affect autism differently in males versus females. With a combination of in-silico modeling and in-vivo chemogenetic manipulations in mice, we first show that a time-series metric estimated from fMRI BOLD signal, the Hurst exponent (H), can be an index for underlying change in the synaptic E:I ratio. In autism we find that H is reduced, indicating increased excitation, in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of autistic males but not females. Increasingly intact MPFC H is also associated with heightened ability to behaviorally camouflage social-communicative difficulties, but only in autistic females.

The fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene is silenced when cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) triplet repeats exceed 200, which is the full mutation that causes FXS. Carriers of FXS have a CGG repeat between 55 and 200, which is defined as a premutation and transcription of the gene is overactive with high levels of the FMR1 mRNA. Most carriers of the premutation have normal levels of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and a normal intelligence, but in the upper range of the premutation (120-200) the FMRP level may be lower than normal. The clinical problems associated with the premutation are caused by the RNA toxicity associated with increased FMR1 mRNA levels, although for some mildly lowered FMRP can cause problems associated with FXS. The RNA toxicity causes various health problems in the carriers including but not limited to fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency, and fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders. Since some individuals with neuropsychiatric problems do not meet the severity for a diagnosis of a ""disorder"" then the condition can be labeled as fragile X premutation associated condition (FXPAC).

We have identified 12 individuals with rare variants (10 loss-of-function, 2 missense) in the BICRA (BRD4 interacting chromatin remodeling complex-associated protein) gene, also known as GLTSCR1, which encodes a subunit of the non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complex. These individuals exhibited neurodevelopmental phenotypes that include developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and behavioral abnormalities as well as dysmorphic features. Notably, the majority of individuals lack the fifth digit/nail hypoplasia phenotype, a hallmark of most SSRIDDs. To confirm the role of BICRA in the development of these phenotypes, we performed functional characterization of the zebrafish and Drosophila orthologs of BICRA. In zebrafish, a mutation of bicra that mimics one of the loss-of-function variants leads to craniofacial defects possibly akin to the dysmorphic facial features seen in individuals harboring putatively pathogenic BICRA variants. We further show that Bicra physically binds to other non-canonical ncBAF complex members, including the BRD9/7 ortholog, CG7154, and is the defining member of the ncBAF complex in flies. Like other SWI/SNF complex members, loss of Bicra function in flies acts as a dominant enhancer of position effect variegation but in a more context-specific manner. We conclude that haploinsufficiency of BICRA leads to a unique SSRIDD in humans whose phenotypes overlap with those previously reported.",pubmed,0.24057072395261878

Epileptic encephalopathy is used to describe an assumed causal relationship between epilepsy and developmental delay. Developmental encephalopathies pathogenesis more independent from epilepsy is supported by the identification of several gene variants associated with both developmental encephalopathies and epilepsy, the possibility for gene-associated developmental encephalopathies without epilepsy, and the continued development of developmental encephalopathies even when seizures are controlled.

Moreover, the interaction between epilepsy and developmental encephalopathies is considered with respect to influence on treatment decisions. Continued research in genetic testing will increase access to clinical tests, earlier diagnosis, better application of current treatments, and potentially provide new molecular-investigated treatments.",pubmed,0.22838969693348551

We describe a simple way to reconstruct a large nail bed defect, with no donor site. A 13-year-old boy with a hypoplastic left heart and autism accidentally sustained a left little distal phalanx injury with an avulsion of 60% of the nail bed, exposing the distal phalanx. This boy had a history of poor compliance, qualifying the need to find a technique that would minimise operative time and dressing changes. As such, it was elected to use an acellular dermal matrix (ADM) (Matriderm) as a one-step reconstruction. Signs of vascularisation of the ADM were noted at 2 weeks, and 3-month follow-up demonstrated integration, with normal nail growth. We found that Matriderm was able to support the regeneration of a full thickness wound in a simple one-step procedure.",pubmed,0.13421654148886095
