8,Comparative Analysis of Convolutional Neural Networks Applied in the Detection of Pneumonia Through X-Ray Images of Children,,,,10.21528/lnlm-vol18-no2-art1,"{'ORCID': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1436-6391', 'authenticated-orcid': False, 'given': 'Luan Oliveira', 'family': 'Silva', 'sequence': 'first', 'affiliation': []}","<jats:p>Pneumonia is one of the most common medical problems in clinical practice and is the leading fatal infectious disease worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, pneumonia kills about 2 million children under the age of 5 and is constantly estimated to be the leading cause of infant mortality, killing more children than AIDS, malaria, and measles combined. A key element in the diagnosis is radiographic data, as chest x-rays are routinely obtained as a standard of care and can aid to differentiate the types of pneumonia. However, a rapid radiological interpretation of images is not always available, particularly in places with few resources, where childhood pneumonia has the highest incidence and mortality rates. As an alternative, the application of deep learning techniques for the classification of medical images has grown considerably in recent years. This study presents five implementations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs): ResNet50, VGG-16, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNeXt50. To support the diagnosis of the disease, these CNNs were applied to solve the classification problem of medical radiographs from people with pneumonia. InceptionResNetV2 obtained the best recall and precision results for the Normal and Pneumonia classes, 93.95% and 97.52% respectively. ResNeXt50 achieved the best precision and f1-score results for the Normal class (94.62% and 94.25% respectively) and the recall and f1-score results for the Pneumonia class (97.80% and 97.65%, respectively).</jats:p>",crossref
20,Protection of Children and Adolescents from Sexual Violence in Brazil: Legislation and Experiences in a Specialized Police Department,,,,10.18178/ijssh.2021.v11.1038,"{'given': 'Izaura', 'family': 'Rodrigues Nascimento', 'sequence': 'first', 'affiliation': []}","<jats:p>The Brazilian Constitution of 1988 represents a milestone due to the provision for comprehensive protection of children and adolescents. It was by this document with which the Police Department for the Protection of Children and Adolescents was created. This department is responsible for investigating sexual crimes. This research reflects the problems faced at the Police Department for the Protection of Children and Adolescents, in the city of Manaus, Amazonas state, Brazil. The study was based on bibliographic and documentary research, which prioritized the relevant legislation, records and institutional reports. It also employed direct observation at the police department and held interviews with 11 police sargeants and 3 psychologists, who were responsible for handling the complaints. The results reveal the high workload of these professionals in attending the public and solving the cases that come to their knowledge.</jats:p>",crossref

5,"Cytoarchitecture of the medial nucleus of trapezoid body of three neotropical species of bats (Noctilio leporinus, Phyllostomus hastatus, and Carollia perspicillata) with different foraging behavior",,General Agricultural and Biological Sciences,,10.1590/1519-6984.230316,"{'ORCID': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6971-6790', 'authenticated-orcid': False, 'given': 'I.', 'family': 'Gibbons', 'sequence': 'first', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'The University of the West Indies,  Trinidad and Tobago'}]}","<jats:p>Abstract The present study was taken to test the hypothesis that the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) of echolocating neotropical bats with different foraging behavior will exhibit morphological variations in relative size, degree of complexity and spatial distribution. The brains were collected from six male adult bats of each species: Noctilio leporinus (fish-eating), Phyllostomus hastatus (carnivorous/ omnivorous) and Carollia perspicillata (fruit-eating) and were double-embedded and transverse serial sections were cut and stained with cresyl fast violet. The results showed that the MNTB is well developed in all the bats in general and the mean length of the MNTB was 1160 ± 124 µm in N. leporinus, 400 ± 59 µm in P. hastatus and 320 ± 25µm in C. perspicillata. The body and brain weight do not reflect proportionately on the size of the MNTB in the present study. The hearing frequency spectrum did not covary with the size of the MNTB among the bats studied. The MNTB is clearly demarcated from the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB) only in P. hastatus. The MNTB comprised mainly three types of cells in all three bats: dense-staining multipolar cells (12.5 µm and 25.0 µm diameter); light-staining multipolar cells measuring (12.5 µm and 25.0 µm diameter) and light-staining round cells (5.0 µm diameter). The large sized MNTB was observed in N. leporinus, which suggests that it relies heavily on echolocation whereas P. hastatus and C. perspicillata use echolocation as well but also rely on hearing, smell and vision.</jats:p>",crossref

9,Impact of Bank Capital and Monetary policy on Lending Behavior of USA Banking Sector Before and After Global Financial Crises,2021-06-15,,,10.47609/0301062021,"{'given': 'Amna', 'family': 'Kausar', 'sequence': 'first', 'affiliation': []}","<jats:p>This study investigates the impact of bank capital, capital structure and monetary policy on the lending behavior of USA banks before and after global financial crises. For this purpose, sample data is collected from the annual reports of top ten banks of USA from 2001 to 2017. A panel unit root is applied to check the stationarity of variables. In order to explain the impact of bank capital, capital structure and monetary policy on lending behavior of USA banks, fixed effect and random effect model have been used. The sample data has been divided into two sets. First data set is taken from 2001 to 2008 before financial crises. Second data set is taken from 2009 to 2017 after financial crises and all above tests have been applied on these data sets. Furthermore, in order to measure the lending behavior three types of lending have been selected lending to consumers, lending to real estate and lending to commercial &amp; industrial sector of USA banks. In order to get the better picture of lending behavior of USA banks before and after financial crises: paired sample T-test has been applied on the data of lending before and after financial crises. Results of paired sample T-test showed there is significant difference in lending to consumers, lending to commercial &amp; industrial sector and lending to real estate before and after financial crises of USA banks because of the implementation of Basel III. So, we accept the alternative hypothesis for our second research question. Findings suggested that impact of bank capital, capital structure and monetary policy has significant impact on the lending behavior before and after the global financial crises with the positive change of sixteen percent in R-squared value. So, we accept the alternative hypothesis for our first research question. The results of coefficients shows that before financial crises (2001 to 2008) discounted interest rates have more significant impact on the lending made to consumers but after the global financial crises (2009 to 2017) discounted interest rates, capital structure and tier 1 capital ratio have more significant impact on the loan made to consumers. The results of coefficients shows that before the financial crises (2001 to 2008) discounted interest rates have more significant impact on the loan made to commercial and industrial sector but after the global financial crises (2009 to 2017) discounted interest rates, capital structure and tier 1 capital ratio have more significant impact on the loan made to commercial and industrial sector. The results of coefficients shows that before financial crises (2001 to 2008) discounted interest rates have more significant impact on the loan made to real estate but after the global financial crises (2009 to 2017) discounted interest rates and capital structure have more significant impact on the loan made to real estate. Findings of our study are aligned with Swamy (2015), who investigated the impact of bank capital on lending spreads and found that increase in capital ratio of banks would also increase their lending spreads. Our results are also matched with the findings of (Kosak et al., 2015), those concluded that capital structure significantly affect the loan growth of banks. Our results are also aligned with Chami &amp; Cosimano (2010), they found that change in monetary policy due to Basel Accord would lead to a change in bank capital and bank loans.</jats:p>",crossref
