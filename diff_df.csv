Teachers in regular education play a critical role in the identification of gifted students and education. Therefore, considering their attitudes toward these students and gifted education in general will provide a deeper understanding of teachers’ needs regarding the quality of gifted education. The present study aims to examine teachers’ perceptions about gifted students through the use of metaphors and attitudes toward gifted education. Qualitative data were collected from 136 teachers utilizing two open-ended questions. Teachers used metaphors based on three categories: gifted education, the social value and various characteristics related to giftedness. The results were discussed in terms of practical implications, teachers’ training needs, educational strategies for gifted students and challenges endemic to the identification process in Turkey. </jats:p>",crossref

The data, which were analyzed via content analysis method, revealed that there were subtle nuances in personality differences between gifted children. Moreover, while the Science and Arts Center (SAC) teachers were more aware of the gifted children’s cognitive traits, while parents were more aware of their children’s affective and personality traits and needs. Furthermore, the results of the study seem to indicate that gifted children are leaders and intelligent, rational, hardworking, knowledgeable, very careful, calm, amusing, funny, curious, and highly observant individuals who like reading books and have a well-developed strong memory. On an average day in their lives, these students allocate spare time for academic success-focused behaviors, their hobbies, and socialization. Among these, the time spent on activities related to academic success and hobbies constitutes the highest amount of ratio. </jats:p>",crossref

This comparative case study investigated the perceptions of 10 participants who completed university-level “Type III experiences.” It extends the sparse research on enrichment and gifted education pedagogy in undergraduate students, framed on Renzulli’s Four-Part Theoretical Model for Gifted Education in the 21st Century. Interviews explored students’ perceptions of the experience and effects on their executive functions and future plans. Using Strauss and Corbin’s technique of open, axial, and selective coding, one overarching theme of this study emerged: support provided for creative productivity led to autonomy and enabled students to complete advanced and creative projects. </jats:p>",crossref

As a complement to Bowlby’s attachment theory, activation relationship theory provides a greater understanding of the impact of fathering on child development, focusing primarily on parental stimulation of risk-taking and control during child exploration. The overarching objective of this article is to better understand the association between children’s relationship quality with both parents, via the activation to father and the attachment to mother relationships, and child externalizing behaviors in a clinical sample. Fifty two-parent families (40 boys and 10 girls) were recruited at random from a population of children receiving treatment at the perinatal and early childhood psychiatry clinic. Results with 44 children (with complete cases) showed that overactivated preschoolers displayed more externalizing behaviors than did children with either an activated or an under-activated relationship with their father. Results also showed that children with a disorganized-controlling caregiving attachment to their mother marginally presented with higher levels of externalizing behavior.</jats:p>",crossref

These psychological foundations remain a strong influence even though the field has since expanded to include other paradigms and greater diversity in conceptions of giftedness and talent. Some researchers argue that the field could benefit from greater interdisciplinary engagement, especially in studies of gifted and talented girls, which tend to include a focus on how gifted girls’ external environments influence their emotional worlds. This article proposes that concepts developed by critical sociologist Pierre Bourdieu are useful for expanding and deepening understandings of the internal and external worlds of gifted and talented girls. It offers evidence from a recent qualitative study with academically gifted and talented teenaged girls in New Zealand. The results highlighted the marginalised position of the gifted and talented identity and the privileging of identities that were based on dispositions versus innate ability. The study also identified a hierarchy of valued forms of capital within the teenage girl social landscape and a resulting theorisation of an empowered gifted and talented girl habitus. This article demonstrates how Bourdieu’s work is a constructive addition to the field.</jats:p>",crossref

The research was aimed to examine the opinions of primary school classroom teachers (N = 1130) employed in Croatian primary schools regarding conceptualization of musical giftedness and its impact on identification of musically gifted students. Furthermore, their opinions about the support of parents, professional team and collective as well as competencies for recognizing and further development of the child’s musical giftedness were investigated. Although most respondents assess their competencies in identifying musical giftedness, most of the surveyed teachers, especially younger ones, are willing to be additionally trained in this area. They stated that the existing curriculum should be expanded and enriched and stressed the need for more support from the expert assistants (psychologists and pedagogues). In addition to the teachers' age, their title (teacher, teacher mentor and teacher advisor) also proved to be a significant factor in the identification and development of a child's musical giftedness. Findings of research have implications for theory and practice of primary school teacher’s music education and education for work with gifted children both during their higher education and lifelong learning.

This is surprising for two reasons: first, there are a number of parallels between the behaviors of children with an insecure and disorganized attachment and the behaviors of children with an ADHD diagnosis. Second, secure attachment has a positive effect on the development of skills in areas in which children with ADHD demonstrate problems (e.g., attention span, impulse control). There are currently no findings on whether or not and how insecure and disorganized attachment and ADHD affect children’s emotion recognition ability. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, part exploratory and part hypothesis-driven in the context of basic research. A clinical sample of 5- to 10-year-old children with an ADHD diagnosis and their parents is to be compared to a non-clinical unaffected control group. Over a period of 3 years, 80 subjects and their parents are to be recruited in each group for participation in the study. Discussion: This study is the first to examine links between attachment, emotion recognition ability, and ADHD. It is also the first to include not just children with ADHD but also their mothers and fathers in its design. The findings should help reduce the research gap and generate more knowledge for family interventions in the case of ADHD.</jats:p>",crossref

Currently, it is thought that generalizing patterns algebraically can serve to provide challenges and opportunities that match their potential. This article focuses on a mathematically gifted student’s use of generalization strategies to identify linear and nonlinear patterns in the context of a matchstick problem. Data were collected from a 10th-grade gifted student’s problem-solving process in a qualitative research design. It was observed that the gifted student’s ways of generalizing the linear and nonlinear patterns were different. In a generalization process, the student used figural reasoning in the linear pattern and numerical reasoning in the nonlinear patterns. It was noted that the student explored using Gauss’s approach in structuring the general rules of nonlinear patterns. Accordingly, aside from assisting their more gifted students, mathematics teachers may want to consider ways to introduce Gaussian thinking to the benefit of all their students. </jats:p>",crossref

                <jats:p>Being gifted with a very high IQ (&gt; 98 percentile) can provide an advantage in the occupational context but can also come with its` own specific challenges. Where some studies found higher than average levels of wellbeing at work and successful careers amongst the gifted, other studies report boredom and less job satisfaction. This poses the question what gifted people value in work, and which factors are associated with the achievement of valued work related outcomes, wellbeing and sustainable employability. In this study these questions were explored using the value driven capability approach as a theoretical framework.</jats:p>

                <jats:p>Participants placed great value on the opportunity to learn, to use their knowledge and skills, and tended to have high ethical standards. If realized, these values contributed to wellbeing whereas if not fulfilled, this often resulted in frustration and sadness. The most important personal factors associated with wellbeing at work and sustainable employability were the level of organizational awareness, self-knowledge, a willingness to compromise, and fear of stigmatisation. Contextually a facilitating leadership style of managers was important, allowing the worker autonomy and decision latitude. Socially, participants enjoyed others as sparring partners but often had an aversion to small talk which could lead to social avoidance and loneliness.</jats:p>

                <jats:p>If gifted workers managed (to get) what they valued in work, this was associated with wellbeing and sustainable employment Coaching aimed at improving organizational awareness, specific social skills (e.g. small talk, adaptability) and understanding their own cognitive processes could be valuable. The application of an autonomy supporting facilitative leadership style by supervisors would be beneficial. Further research should try to confirm the findings using quantitative methods and needs to examine more closely the impact of stigmatisation and leadership styles.</jats:p>

Tourists, especially fans are no longer satisfied with the traditional tourist attractions with special symbolic meanings when visiting South Korea, but instead focus on common places associated with idols. For example, restaurants, cafes, bookstores, parks and convenience stores that have appeared in an idol’s social network accounts. With the application of the theory of attachment and sense of place in the tourism field, this study will start from the celebrity attachment, to exploring the specific processes and mechanisms by which idols affect the behavioral intentions of the fans. The associations between visitors and idol-related places based on celebrity attachments has also become possible, and the fans/tourists’ opinions and attitudes toward idol-related places will also change due to this emotional attachment. Relevant data were collected in the form of online questionnaires, and 440 valid responses were finalized for data analysis. Through data analysis, all the hypotheses proposed in this paper are supported, and there are significant relationships and positive influences among the variables. Data analysis results show that idol attachment can positively influence the four cognitive dimensions of sense of place (place identity, place dependence, social bonding and atmosphere). The various dimensions of sense of place can promote the generation of place attachment.</jats:p>",crossref

This study used a qualitative method with a descriptive analysis approach without using statistical formulas or formulas or SPSS assistance. The data in this study were obtained from the analysis of conversation or dialogue as well as the development of the Early Dini Suryani language of the third-grade students of SDN 27 / III Lolo Kecil with their peers, interacting in class with the teacher and while in the family environment. Researchers found that early language development was different from normal children who tended to have the use of well-ordered and well-structured language. Dini also uses a variety of vocabulary that is appropriate for certain contexts. The use of intonation and facial expression in interacting was also applied by Dini in communicating. Even so, Dini has a mental disorder that is high egoistic like when she wants everything she will do even though she forces her will. To maximize early abilities character education is the right support step or method. Thus, Dini can be a gifted child with a good personality.</jats:p>",crossref

Differentiating ‘attachment difficulties’ from autism spectrum disorder (hereafter autism) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (hereafter ADHD) has been characterised as challenging. Few studies have explored how this happens in practice, from the perspective of the professionals. Design: Qualitative study. Method: We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with (n=17) healthcare professionals from five NHS Foundation Trusts in the United Kingdom. Participants were recruited using a combination of snowballing, convenience and purposive sampling. Data were analysed using a thematic approach. Results: We identified six interrelated themes that might reflect difficulties with differential conceptualisation. These include: a clinical lexicon of attachment; approaching attachment with caution; contextual factors; perceived characteristic behaviours; assessing attachment and adjacent supports; spotlighting intervention and dual conceptualisation. Conclusion: Our results indicate some of the ways suspicions around attachment are raised in practice. We advocate for more dialogue between research and practice communities on issues of differential conceptualisation. We call for collaboration between a panel of experts consisting of attachment and neurodevelopmental orientated practitioners and researchers, to clarify issues around differentiating between attachment difficulties, ASD and ADHD.</p>",crossref

The model is then used as a framework for reviewing literature regarding gifted adolescents' psychosocial adjustment. On the whole, the literature provides a positive view of the psychosocial adjustment of gifted adolescents.

Stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, limitations in holding or touching the baby, and medical complications during the NICU stay can negatively affect parental mental health. This can threaten the developing parent-infant relationship and might adversely impact child development. Music therapy in the NICU is an internationally growing field of clinical practice and research and is increasingly applied to promote relationship building between parents and babies. The two most commonly used concepts describing the early parent-infant relationship are ‘attachment’ and ‘bonding’. While frequently used interchangeably in the literature, they are actually not the same and describe distinctive processes of the early relationship formation. Thus, it is important to discuss the overlaps and differences between attachment and bonding and the implications for music therapy clinical practice and research. Whereas providing examples and possible scenarios for music therapists working on either bonding or attachment, the distinction between both concepts is relevant for many health care professionals concerned with early parenting interventions in the NICU. This will hopefully lead to a more precise use of theory, and ultimately, to a more informed clinical practice and research.</jats:p>",crossref

Objective: The study investigates the association between perceived primary parenting styles and attachment styles between single parent children and children living with both parents.
Methods: A correlational research study was carried out on a sample of 200 children, 100single parent children (Boys=50; Girls=50) taken from single parent families living in child protection and welfare bureau and 100 children living with both parents (Boys=50; Girls=50) enrolled in different grades taken from a private school of Lahore, through purposive sampling strategy. The study was carried out at Lahore Garrison University from September 2017 to march 2017.After obtaining permission from authorities, children were given Parental Authority Questionnaireand the Urdu version of Inventory of Parental and Peer attachment.
Results:The results showed that there was a significant negative correlation between permissive parenting styles with mother’scommunication (*p&lt;.05); authoritarian parenting style has negative correlation with parental communication, and trust(***p&lt;.001). Authoritative parenting has significant positive relationship with trust (***p&lt;.001), and communication with parents (***p&lt;.001), negative relationship between authoritative parenting with feeling alienated from parents (*p&lt;.01). The resultsof t-test also revealed that single parent children perceive their parents as authoritarian (***p&lt;.001) and had more alienated attachment with parents (***p&lt;.001), whereas children living with both parents had more trust (***p&lt;.001) and had better communication with their parents (***p&lt;.001).
Conclusion: Current research is insightful in understanding the role of parents and different parenting styles in building up strong parent child attachment.

However, due to the need for symptom management, many infants diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) may be separated from primary caregivers and cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or special care nursery (SCN) soon after birth. Research has shown that substance-exposed infants are more likely to experience insecure attachment patterns with their primary caregivers and that mothers with a history of substance abuse are less sensitive to their infants’ cues. Therefore, the aim of this research was to explore nurses’ and midwives’ experiences in promoting the attachment relationship for infants admitted to an NICU/SCN with NAS. A qualitative research design was used to gather data on the experiences of nine nurses/midwives from various NICU and SCN settings in Australia. Individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted, and transcribed interviews were coded using thematic analysis. While nurses/midwives valued the attachment relationship for infants with NAS, facilitation of the attachment relationship was mainly promoted when the mother was present. However, parents were often reported to be absent from the nursery. Difficulties in promoting an attachment relationship were also identified when an infant had child protection involvement. This research identifies areas in need of innovative change regarding the approach taken to promote the attachment relationship for infants with NAS when they are admitted to an NICU/SCN.</jats:p>",crossref

However, levels of secure base script knowledge did not differ between low-risk parents and CPS-referred parents who had received the ABC intervention. In addition, secure base script knowledge was positively associated with parental sensitivity during interactions with their 8-year-old children among low-risk and CPS-referred parents. Mediational analyses supported the idea that the ABC intervention enhanced parents’ sensitivity 7 years later indirectly via increases in parents’ secure base script knowledge.</jats:p>",crossref

Meanwhile, Singaporean students have been among the top achievers in all these competitions. Many comparative studies have been done between different nations and Singapore, but in few, if any, of these studies the focus has been on comparisons regarding gifted education. Singaporean policies and practices on gifted education generally prioritise a commitment to engaging learners from all ability levels with appropriately challenging curricula and instruction. In this article we report on a comparative study between the Singaporean and South African education systems. Three frames, (a) political context (b) curriculum structure and (c) loose coupling shaped the analysis. Results show that both countries had similar challenges at the point of independence from colonial rule and yet, they responded differently to those challenges. Singapore implemented inclusive education driven by excellence while South Africa’s inclusive education is driven by equity without excellence. South Africa has a one-size-fits-all curriculum, whereas Singapore has alternatives that create multiple pathways for learners to reach their full potential. Although gifted education is being proposed in current South African pronouncements, there is no evidence of coherence in terms of its implementation. Meanwhile, Singapore has a coherent system that ensures their policies move from theory into practice. All these are lessons that South Africa can learn.</jats:p>",crossref

Could moderate-intensity disaster improve psychological and attachment functioning through its effects on social functioning? We used a prospective quasi-experimental cohort design to investigate this possibility among college students. Hurricane cohort participants ( N = 209) completed assessments before, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks after Hurricane Sandy. Two matched comparison cohorts ( Ns &gt; 140) were assessed 4 months and 1 year later. The hurricane cohort, in contrast to matched comparison cohorts, reported increased social support, reduced global distress, reduced negative emotion, and reduced attachment avoidance at the end of the semester. Increased social support mediated the relationship between hurricane cohort and reduced global distress, negative emotion, attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiety, and increased positive emotion and self-esteem at 6 weeks poststorm. The results suggest moderate disaster exposure can benefit short-term social, psychological, and attachment functioning, underscoring the critical role of the social context in stress adaptation. </jats:p>",crossref

169,The roots of creativity.,,,American journal of psychoanalysis,,,"The various factors which seem to be important in the creative child with extraordinary potential include: A good biologic endowment, often with high intelligence and a correlation between special sensory sensitivities and other physical requirements to implement the special interest. There is also sometimes the capacity to utilize or else compensate for deficit. The fostering of interests by a parent or interested adult. Specific kinds of ongoing encouragement. Sometimes there is self-selection of interest by the child. The child must feel valued and loved. The family background and relationship of parents centers on the child. The time, place, and institutions foster the development of interest and value of the work and the child's belief in its value. The child is allowed freedom of development, without undue inhibition or restriction. Creative people have shown uneven development--the child is not ""age-specific"" generally. Gifted children have been observed to tolerate isolation and even loneliness well--these are often necessary conditions for developing skills. For some creative people, early object losses seem to be frequent. The creative child is curious and a keen observer. The creative child has an uncanny ability to make connections--to perceive similarities in the apparently dissimilar. The creative child is not hampered by conventional thought. The creative child has a capacity for love and devotion--or at least a positive orientation; a spiritness or passion; and a spirituality or unworldliness. It has been said that the poetic truths in a work of art are only half understood by its creator. Generally conveyed subliminally, these truths are revealed in different ways to different audiences at different times. Such is the view of William Livingstone (1987), and considering the childhood antecedents of creative work helps to understand why this is so.",pubmed

Attachment-Based Family Therapy (ABFT), as the only empirically supported family therapy model designed to treat adolescent depression, aims to repair interpersonal ruptures and rebuild an emotionally protective parent-child relationship. <jats:bold>Objective: </jats:bold>To study the effectiveness of ABFT compared with treatment as usual (TAU) delivered within child- and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to adolescents with MDD.<jats:bold>Method:</jats:bold> Sixty adolescents (86.7% girls), aged 13-18 years (M = 14.9, SD = 1.35), with MDD referred to two CAMHS were randomized to 16 weeks of ABFT or TAU. ABFT consisted of weekly therapy sessions (family/individual or both) according to the treatment manual. TAU was not monitored. Primary outcomes were assessed by blinded evaluators at baseline and post-treatment with the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Self-reported (Beck Depression Inventory-II, BDI-II) depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline, and after 4, 6, 8, 10,12, 14, and 16 weeks. Analyses were performed according to intent-to-treat principles. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> At post-treatment, clinician-rated remission rates on the HAMD (5 % in ABFT and 3.33% in TAU, p =1, OR=1.54, Fisher’s exact test) and self-reported symptoms of depression on the BDI-II did not differ significantly between groups (X2[2, N = 60] =0.06 , p = 0.97). In both treatment groups participants reported significantly reduced depressive symptoms, but the majority (63.3 %) of adolescents were still in the clinical range after 16 weeks of treatment. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> ABFT was not superior to TAU. Remission and response rates were low in both groups, suggesting none of the treatments were effective in treating MDD in adolescents. Findings must be viewed in the context of the study’s small sample size, missing data, and implementation challenges. Continued efforts to improve treatment for MDD in outpatient clinics are warranted . Future research should examine moderators of and mechanisms for individual differences to treatment response, as well as the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of implementing treatment models which may require extensive training and expertise to yield clinically meaningful improvements in non-research settings. <jats:bold>Trial Registration:</jats:bold> Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01830088 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01830088?term=Villab%C3%B8&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1 Date of registration: April 12, 2013</jats:p>",crossref

We analyzed publicly available district gifted program plans (Grades 3-5) from two states to examine the extent to which district identification practices matched intervention strategies. Our team developed a coding scheme matrix with 133 items for State 1 ( n = 115) and State 2 ( n = 178). The results of this study indicated that, at least in terms of planning, districts in the two states we examined appeared to be aligning identification and programming practices to meet the needs of gifted students identified in mathematics and/or reading/English language arts. In State 1, at least 60% of the districts reported the following intervention strategies in mathematics and reading/English language arts: faster pace of coverage, regular grade-level standards, in-depth coverage, preassessment, above grade-level standards, and expanded grade-level standards. In contrast, State 2 districts reported faster pace of coverage; however, with less commonly utilized interventions, subject-matter identification significantly influenced their usage. Differentiation was the primary learning environment strategy utilized by districts in both states. </jats:p>",crossref

167,The human mind: building bridges between neuroscience and psychiatry.,,,Psychiatry,,,"This essay proposes the existence of four unique behavioral characteristics that distinguish Homo sapiens from its nearest evolutionary kin, the great apes. These are inventiveness, capacity for language, curiosity, and self-reflection or self-analysis. Some would counterargue that none of these features are ""unique"" to humans. Examples would be given of animal ""intelligence"" involving at times surprising problem-solving abilities. Even ""conversations"" between humans and parrots might be cited. However, this is to misunderstand what the focus is in the article. This is not a thesis on the continuity or discontinuities of evolution. Every well-trained biologist learns about evolution and understands that the most complex human traits have some hint of related traits in nearest relatives. Rather, the emphasis of this article has been to select and emphasize certain distinctive aspects of human behavior that are the most important features distinguishing human ""uniqueness."" Uniqueness may be quantified by the number and complexity of processes within the four attributes presented in this article. While this may be an interesting mathematical exercise, the author would rather take it for granted that the outcome would be that humans are significantly more complex in each of the four features referred to than the great apes. For those in the mental health field, one would hope that this overview of the most highly evolved systems in human brain may provide a useful framework where creative therapeutic processes can be applied to the ultimate beneficiary, the client or patient. This article proposes that psychosis can be considered the impossibility of conflict resolution among the special neuronal assemblies that separately mediate feelings of attachment versus abandonment, security versus anxiety, calmness versus anger, fulfillment versus helplessness, and satisfaction of sexual needs. Given this model, the role of the therapist is to consider whether the client is in touch with the various equilibrium points in their current life situation or crisis. A questionnaire designed to help access information on these internal states may work better than an oral interview because it forces the client to reflect. How much conflict does the client feel in sorting out personal priorities? Does the client have any practice at resolving internal conflicts? If unpracticed, is the client likely to act out in destructive ways to self or others to resolve the pressure of internal conflicts? I am sure that we can all think of current well-publicized destructive acts in which one has to wonder precisely what model of mind the psychotherapists were using to assist the client. At a higher level, each human has the potential to be creative. Whether expressed as curiosity about the universe and nature or inventiveness, as in improving the quality of one's life or by the use of gifted language as in art and music, the therapist needs to determine how to assist the client into these kinds of self-defined fulfillments, which one hopes will reduce the other tensions of conflict resolution. There is no doubt that the journey for both the client and therapist will be challenging. Ultimately, the journey is the reward for both the client and therapist. In closing, the following quotation seems appropriate. Sydney Brenner (2002), a pioneer in molecular biology, reviewed a current book on the Science, Politics, and Ethics of the Human Genome Project (Sulston and Ferry 2002). He states, ""What I found interesting in the account is that Sulston doesn't tell us anything about the genomes he has sequenced. What did he find there that excited him? What did he learn about genes, about life, about evolution, about worlds to come? It is the play of Hamlet without Hamlet"" (p. 794).",pubmed

What dispositional factors predict autonomy flourishing during goal pursuit?  Methods: Four longitudinal studies were conducted over an 8-month academic year, and university students (N total = 1544) completed surveys on motivation, support, and personality. Structural equation models were created using MPlus software to test whether collaborative personality factors were related to growth in autonomous motivation and autonomy support. Results: All three distinct collaborative personality factors, trait agreeableness, assisted autonomy striving, and secure parental attachment, were related to increases in autonomous motivation over the academic year. Conscientiousness, assisted autonomy, and secure attachment were related to increases in perceived autonomy support. A higher order latent collaborative traits factor, composed of agreeableness, assisted autonomy, and secure attachment was found to be related to increased autonomous motivation and support over the academic year and resulted in increased goal progress. Conclusion: These results suggest that individuals higher in collaborative personality factors experience growth in personal autonomy during goal pursuit. Future research is needed to determine how to promote collaboration in goal pursuit to further help individuals successfully strive for their goals.</p>",crossref

Besides, the goal was to evaluate the relationship between the variables of the use of humor, the process of coping through a sense of humor, and the appreciating humor in cases of ignoring and avoiding during social exclusion. A relational screening model was used in the research. Among the research variables included in the model, social exclusion (ostracism) is considered as a dependent variable, while the sense of humor is an independent variable. The study group is composed of 202 students who are diagnosed as gifted and talented students. Within the scope of the study, the “Multidimensional Sense of Humor Scale for Children” developed by Akın and Bilgin (2015) and the “Social Exclusion Scale for Adolescents” developed by Sertelin Mercan (2016) have been applied. When the data collected as a result of the study was examined, it was revealed that there was a positive relationship between the sub-dimensions of generating a sense of humor, coping through humor, and appreciating humor, which is the sense of humor sub-dimensions of gifted and talented students and the exclusion subdimension of social exclusion.

This is presented with relevant real-world examples and #BlackVoices through youth poetry. The framework of critical race theory is used as a lens, to situate the world in which Black joy is found. The author argues that this manifestation, situated within the structural racism ever present in the system of education, has the unfortunate impact of igniting educators’ anti-blackness, resulting in the missingness (Gentry et al., 2019) of gifted Black students from gifted programs and services. The author delves into constructs of white supremacy, white rage, and antiblackness as the foundational concepts that contribute to this missingness, using research and more youth poetry to substantiate the claims. #BlackVoices are featured throughout, as emic perspectives, giving voice, heart, soul, and joy to the research, the words on the page.</p>",crossref

The study sample consisted of (80) gifted graduates’ adults from Jubilee school graduates, whose ages range from (26-41). The descriptive-survey method was used to achieve study goals. The results indicated that all life goals were of high importance to the respondents, regardless of gender. Significant differences were identified in the achievement of life goals attributed to the gender variable in favor of females. The result also showed no fundamental differences in the degree of importance of life goals attributed to the degree of religiosity. The study results revealed that gifted adults focus mainly on achieving goals and professional success, and they achieve themselves through the profession. They see that a promising future means career success and economic power enables them to achieve life goals related to their partner and family.&#x0D;

Women with fibromyalgia (FM) commonly suffer from depression, pervasive fatigue, and pain. The attachment style has been hypothesized to be an important factor for understanding the experience of these symptoms. Therefore, the present cross-sectional study is aimed at investigating the effect of attachment styles in women with a diagnosis of FM on depressive symptoms and quality of life. Method. Participants were 453 Italian women with a physician’s diagnosis of FM with a mean age of 47 years (<jats:inline-formula>
                     <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1"">

                  </jats:inline-formula>). To assess attachment styles, quality of life, and depressive symptoms, women responded, respectively, to the Relationship Questionnaire, the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory II. Results. Our results showed that the incidence of depressive symptoms was elevated, with 59% of women reporting moderate to severe symptoms. Also, the statistical analyses showed that both preoccupied and avoidant/dismissing attachments were related with depression symptoms and low perception of QoL. Conclusions. Our study demonstrates that, when evaluating the impact of FM on the QoL of women, it is important to consider the complexity of the variables that are at play. Insecure attachment styles and depressive symptoms seem to increase the likelihood of the psycho-social-somatic malaise in FM women.</jats:p>",crossref

The EAO is delivered as part of the universal offer at the routine 6–8-week health visitor contact. The EAO protocol requires the health visitor to ask the primary caregiver three questions about the emerging relationship between themselves and their infant: Describe your relationship with your baby in three words; What is the best thing about your relationship with your baby?; and What is your biggest fear about your relationship with your baby? The health visitor completes a 2-minute observation of the interactions between the infant and parent. The purpose of the EAO is to screen for emerging attachment difficulties, in line with the WAVE report Conception to Age 2: The Age of Opportunity. The EAO is now a crucial element of the Leeds Early Start infant mental health pathway. The purpose of this article is to outline the development, pilot, implementation and evaluation of the use of the EAO in Leeds. </jats:p>",crossref

The researchers gathered interview data from participants with corroborating evidence from their parents and their book club teacher. The grounded theory analyses found advanced readers to demonstrate superior reading comprehension and the ability to read entire books quickly. Participants reported positive attitudes toward reading in general and preferred out of school reading over the limiting structures of school reading. Some evidence supported a connection between reading and identity exploration through narrative imagination and empathetic relations to characters and narratives. Advanced readers may present cognitive characteristics, as well as behaviors and motivations that require differentiated learning designs. </jats:p>",crossref

According to moral core researchers, infants are born with a moral sense that allows them to care about and evaluate the actions of third parties. In attachment theory, care manifests through infants' relationships with caregivers, which forms representations called internal working models that shape how babies think, feel, and act. Although accumulating evidence supports the existence of a moral core directed toward others, nevertheless, without a notion of care connected to infants' own lives, the core is an incomplete and underpowered construct. We show how the moral core, like attachment, could emerge in first- and second-person working models that develop through social interaction and incorporate representational forms (embodied, social, cognitive, emotional, moral), which contribute to the emergence of third-person representations and give infants' moral sense its vitality and meaning. </jats:p>",crossref

The c-di-GMP system in <jats:italic>E. amylovora</jats:italic> is comprised of 12 diguanylate cyclase/Edc (dimerize cyclic-di-GMP) and phosphodiesterase/Pde (hydrolyze cyclic-di-GMP) proteins that are characterized by the presence of GGDEF and/or EAL motifs in their domain architecture. In order to study the global regulatory effect (without the inclusion of systemic regulatory impedance) of the c-di-GMP system in <jats:italic>E. amylovora</jats:italic>, we eliminated all 12 <jats:italic>edc</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>pde</jats:italic> genes in <jats:italic>E. amylovora</jats:italic> Ea1189Δ12. Comparisons between the representative transcriptomic profiles of Ea1189Δ12 and the combinatorial <jats:italic>edc</jats:italic> gene knockout mutant (Ea1189Δ5) revealed marked overall distinctions in expression levels for targets in a wide range of regulatory categories, including metabolic pathways involved in the utilization of methionine, isoleucine, histidine, etc. as well as critical signal transduction pathways including the Rcs phosphorelay and PhoPQ system. A complete loss of the cyclic-di-GMP signaling components resulted in the inability of Ea1189Δ12 cells to attach to and form biofilms in vitro and within the xylem vasculature in apple shoots. Using a flow-based in vitro biofilm system, we found that initial surface sensing was primarily dependent on the flagellar filament (FliC), following which the type IV pilus (HofC) was required to anchor cells to the surface to initialize biofilm development. A transcriptomic analysis of WT <jats:italic>E. amylovora</jats:italic> Ea1189 and Ea1189Δ12 cells in various stages of biofilm development revealed that cyclic-di-GMP based regulation had widespread effects on purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis pathways, amylovoran biosynthesis genes and the EnvZ/OmpR signal transduction system. Additionally, complementing individual eliminated genes back into Ea1189Δ12, and the collective evaluation of several virulence factors, enabled the correlative clustering of the functional effect rendered by each Edc and Pde enzyme in the system.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Significance</jats:title><jats:p>Cyclic-di-GMP dependent regulation, in the context of biofilm formation, has been studied in several bacterial systems. However, the comprehensiveness of the studies exploring the role of individual genetic components related to cyclic-di-GMP is affected by the often large number of diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase enzymes present within individual bacterial systems. To explore the evolutionary dependencies related to cyclic-di-GMP in <jats:italic>E. amylovora</jats:italic>, we used a collective elimination approach, whereby all of the enzymes involved in cyclic-di-GMP metabolism were eliminated from the system. This approach enabled us to highlight the critical importance of cyclic-di-GMP in plant xylem colonization due to its effect on surface attachment. Additionally, we highlight the global transcriptomic effect of cyclic-di-GMP dependent signaling at various stages of biofilm development. Our approach is aimed at exploring the regulatory role of individual cyclic-di-GMP related enzymes in a background that is free from any redundancy-based feedback.</jats:p></jats:sec>",crossref

AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate, using 3D FE analysis (FEA), the influence of two different types of attachments on the rate of bone resorption, need for maintenance and implant/attachment life time in cases of unpredictable osseointegration in various bone types and using different implant angulations.&#x0D;
METHODS: Six finite element models were prepared; three for the locator attachment while the other three for the ball attachment. Each of the three models simulates vertical implant and inclined implants by 10° and 20° degrees. Frictional contact between implant and cortical bone simulated the incomplete osseointegration scenario.&#x0D;
RESULTS: Non-linear static analysis results showed that locator attachment and its cap may have longer time life in comparison with the ball attachment and its cap.&#x0D;
CONCLUSIONS: Both attachments were safe for cortical and spongy bone, while the cortical bone receives less Von Mises stress by up to 33% with the increased implant angulation.</jats:p>",crossref

In a letter to her therapist a gifted patient speaks of the symptoms and treatment of her illness. This provides the basis for studying the precipitous transference relationships in borderline patients and the urgent need in these patients for clarity and dependability from their therapists. Common fears of being ""set adrift"" by psychotherapy are contrasted to the characteristic tenacity of the patient-therapist bond. A review of the patient's life allows the reader to evaluate the clinical applicability of her insights. The letter's multiple communicative functions illustrate some of the qualities of the object relations sought by borderline personalities, and stress is placed upon the sublimatory aspect of such letters and the prognostic importance of the capacities for sublimation.",pubmed

A total of 241 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years were investigated to determine the incidence as well as the characteristics and functions of such fictitious individuals in this age group. Content analysis of data obtained from questionnaires revealed that the imaginary companion was similar to the writer in many aspects. The imaginary companion supported the adolescent during the process of developing his/her identity. The relative influence of self-concept, creativity, role-taking ability, coping behavior, and egocentrism was then investigated using a hierarchical regression model. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) the deficit hypothesis, i.e. only adolescents with a deficit in social interaction create an imaginary companion, (2) the giftedness hypothesis, i.e. especially creative adolescents invent such a companion and (3) the egocentrism hypothesis, i.e. the construction of an imaginary companion is the result of perceived uniqueness and related to personal fable and imaginary audience behaviour. The results showed that the imaginary companion was not the result of an egocentric orientation, and by no means was a substitute for other trustworthy partners such as family members or friends. On the contrary, socially competent and creative adolescents with good coping abilities were particularly prone to create such a ""very special friend"".",pubmed

1236,GIFTED PERSONALITY IN A MULTICULTURAL ENVIRONMENT: PROBLEMS OF ADAPTATION,2021-02-23 00:00:00,,,10.32999/ksu2413-1865/2020-93-1,"{'ORCID': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2303-1147', 'authenticated-orcid': False, 'given': 'Tkachenko', 'family': 'L.I.', 'sequence': 'first', 'affiliation': []}","<jats:p>The  article  is  devoted  to  the  topical  problem  of  adaptation  of  gifted  children  in  the  educational space  of  a  modern  school  taking  into  account  the  multicultural  environment  formed  by  the  contingent of  students  of  different  ethnicities  and  cultures. The  author  points  out  the  need  for  pedagogical  support of the adaptation of gifted students. Based on modern research in the field of philosophy, sociology, psychology, and semiosociopsychology, the author formulates the basic principles of adaptation in a multicultural society of an educational institution.Sustainable development of society and security of the country can be ensured by the formation of national identity in all members of society, which means unity of aspirations, coherence, and peaceful coexistence in the perspectives. This is especially true for Ukraine, which today not only strives for sustainable development but also is forced to defend its independence and integrity. In the conditions of modern civilization development, it is a question of formation in the person of so-called multilevel identity which, on the one hand, means belonging to a certain ethnic group that provides the person full disclosure of its abilities, and on the other – guarantees formation of the feeling of belonging to the wider community – the nation (multinational entity, united by a common historical destiny and the idea of security and development of their own state).Self-identification of the individual (or the formation of a multi-tiered identity) is important because it is the key to its successful self-realization. It is closely linked to deep mental formations, the leading one being ethnic identity. This is especially true for the gifted person because talents can develop and fully ensure the self-realization of the individual, provided it is successfully adopted in society. The success of the adaptation of a gifted person in a multicultural society can be ensured under the condition of purposeful pedagogical support, the principles of organization of which are formulated in the article. It is noted that to reveal the giftedness of a person, his intellectual development should take into account the formation of the semiosphere related to ethnicity, and the formation of national identity should be based on the formation of a common semiosphere of all participants in the educational process.Key words: national identity, ethnicity, semiospace, self-identification, self-realization, education.              Статтю присвячено актуальній проблемі адаптації обдарованих дітей в освітньому просторі сучас-ної школи з урахуванням полікультурного середовища, що утворюється контингентом учнів різних етносів і культур. Автор вказує на необхідність педагогічного супроводу адаптації обдарованих учнів. Спираючись на сучасні дослідження в області філософії, соціології, психології і семіосоціопсихології, автор формулює основні принципи організації адаптації в полікультурному соціумі освітнього закладу.Сталий розвиток суспільства й безпека країни можуть бути забезпеченими за умови формування національної ідентичності у всіх представників соціуму країни, що означає єдність прагнень, узгодженість дій та мирне співіснування в майбутньому. Особливо це актуально для України, яка нині не лише прагне до сталого розвитку, а й змушена відстоювати свою незалежність і цілісність. В умовах сучасного цивілізаційного розвитку йдеться про формування в особистості так званої багатоярусної ідентичності, яка, з одного боку, означає приналежність до певної етнічної групи, що забезпечує особистості повне розкриття її здібностей, а з другого – гарантує формування відчуття приналежності до більш широкої спільноти – нації (багатонаціонального утворення, що об’єднане спільністю історичної долі та ідеєю безпеки й розвитку власної держави).Самоідентифікація особистості (або формування багатоярусної ідентичності) є важливою, оскільки є запорукою її успішної самореалізації. Вона тісно пов’язана з глибокими ментальними утвореннями, провідною з яких є етнічна ідентичність. Особливо це актуально для обдарованої особистості, оскільки обдарування можуть розвинутися й повною мірою забезпечити самореалізацію особистості за умови її успішної адаптації в соціумі. Успішність адаптації обдарованої особистості в полікультурному соціумі може бути забезпечено за умови цілеспрямованого педагогічного супроводу, принципи організації яко-го й сформульовано у статті. Зазначено, що для розкриття обдарованості особистості має відбуватися її інтелектуальний розвиток з урахуванням формування семіосфери, пов’язаної з етнічною приналежністю, а формування національної ідентичності має відбуватися на основі формування спільної семіосфери усіх учасників освітнього процесу на основі опанування семіосфери державної мови, спільної для всіх учасників освітнього процесу.Ключові слова: національна ідентичність, етнічність, семіопростір, самоідентифікація, само-реалізація, освіта.</jats:p>",crossref

1240,[Ignatius of Loyola--gifted or mentally ill?].,,,Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie,,,"Subsequent to a severe injury and under the influence of religious reading, Loyola experienced a dramatic mental change in his spiritual values in the sense of a sublimation to an alternative knighthood. His behaviour patterns observed thereafter were determined by a totality of his attachment to God. Based on this certainty in his faith, which was free from any doubts, and on God, and with the background of fasting and praying, he had visionary and pseudo-hallucinatory experiences. As the founder of an order and head of the community of Jesuits, Ignatius of Loyola proved to be diplomatically highly talented. There is no evidence of any psychotic disease. Also, there is no probability of a personality disorder in the sense of a neurosis. The numerous unusual behaviour patterns of Ignatius cannot be interpreted as psychopathological symptoms. It is justified to call him a genius.",pubmed
1241,The princess in the tower: Zelda Fitzgerald's creative impasse.,,,Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association,,,"Gifted women often find it difficult to integrate an acceptable social image with an autonomous artistic identity. This paper explores the ambitions and conflicts of Zelda Fitzgerald, who aspired to be an artist in several fields, but whose fame is largely contingent on the role she played in the life of her husband, F. Scott Fitzgerald. Zelda's flamboyant public pose, which served as a model for many of her husband's literary characters, is interpreted as an attempt to organize a consistent identity configuration by means of constant appeals for applause from an admiring audience. But although this configuration provided some stability and cohesion for her during her twenties, it was a superficial and vulnerable structure which failed to support her serious artistic aspirations. An examination of the separation conflicts and difficulties in internalization which contributed to Zelda's dilemma leads to a consideration of the role of the father in the organization of differentiated female achievements. Although Zelda Fitzgerald's pathology was extreme, her struggles suggest useful insights into the intrapsychic and social barriers commonly confronting creative women.",pubmed

Nevertheless, no robust study has explored the ASQ questionnaire in Spanish compared to other cultures, such as Italian and Japanese. Therefore, the linguistic translation of the Spanish version of the ASQ was performed, based on the back-translation methodology. The results indicate that 5-factors ASQ Spanish version explains 43.67% of the variance, similar to the original English-Australian ASQ version. The Italian and Japanese versions explain 49.37% and 52.27% of the variance, respectively. No age correlation for any ASQ factors in the Japanese sample was found; meanwhile, the Spanish and Italian cultures showed a positive correlation with age and “Confidence” and negative correlation with age and “Relationships as Secondary” ASQ factors.

The goal of this work is to test in a non-clinical population of adults the mediation role of Fear of Intimacy and Adult Attachment in the relationship between Alexithymia and Self-Differentiation. A sample of 258 participants self identified as gay or lesbian, aged 20–50 years (M: 30.29; SD: 7.27), 45% of whom were males, completed self-reported measures of Alexithymia (TAS-20), Self-Differentiation (SDI), Fear of Intimacy (FIS); and Insecure Adult Attachment (RAAS). Our results show that Alexithymia predicts Self-Differentiation both directly and indirectly, through Fear of Intimacy and Insecure adult attachment. In addition, Fear of Intimacy directly influences Self-Differentiation, and also mediates the relationship between Alexithymia and Adult Attachment which, in turn, negatively predicts Self-Differentiation. In conclusion, Alexithymia predicts Self-Differentiation while Fear of Intimacy and adult attachment may act as mediators of the report.

Study 2 uses an alternative manipulation of partner phubbing and explores the moderating role of interpersonal attachment anxiety in the relationship between partner phubbing, romantic jealousy, and relationship satisfaction. Study 2 finds that partner phubbing and attachment anxiety have an interactive effect on jealousy, which then leads to relationship satisfaction. Study 3 employs a survey and finds that partner phubbing has downstream negative effects on well-being through romantic jealousy, but only among anxiously attached individuals. The heavy use of technology, especially smartphones, in the presence of one’s romantic partner, and the negative outcomes associated with partner phubbing, establishes the importance of research in this area.

The Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale (MAAS) was used to assess maternal-fetal attachment.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The prevalence of prenatal depression in the participants was high (19.1%) in our study. The scores of prenatal anxiety and sleep disorders were higher with prenatal depression than in those without prenatal depression (47.6 ± 9.5 vs. 38.9 ± 6.9; 8.3 ± 3.3 vs. 6.1 ± 2.7, all <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.01). MAAS quality was lower in prenatal depression women than those in non-prenatal depression women (43.8 ± 5.6 vs. 46.4 ± 4.5, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.01). Correlation analysis showed that prenatal depression was associated with parity, prenatal education, education level, marital satisfaction, anxiety and sleep disorders (all <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, binary logistic regression results showed that anxiety and sleep disorders were risk factors for prenatal depression. Prenatal education, higher marriage satisfaction were protective factors for prenatal depression. In addition, correlation analysis also showed that prenatal depression was positively correlated with MAAS intensity, but negatively correlated with MAAS quality.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Our results indicated a high prevalence of prenatal depression in women in the third trimester. Prenatal education and higher marital satisfaction were protective factors for prenatal depression; antenatal anxiety and sleep disorders during pregnancy were risk factors for prenatal depression.

        <jats:p>ObjectiveThis retrospective study aimed to investigate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of open-door laminoplasty with modified centerpiece mini-plate fixation and extensor attachment point reconstruction for treating cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).MethodSixty-nine patients with CSM, who underwent C3-7 open-door laminoplasty in our hospital from January 2016 to May 2017, were divided into two groups: group A underwent surgery with a modified centerpiece titanium plate and group B underwent surgery with a conventional centerpiece titanium plate. Changes in cervical spinal angle (CSA), cervical range of motion (ROM), atrophy of posterior cervical muscles, and neurological function (Japanese Orthopaedic Association [JOA] score) and the occurrence of axial symptoms (AS) were compared between the groups.ResultThere were no significant differences in operative time, intra-operative blood loss, lamina open angle, and spinal cord drift distance between the groups. After the surgery, JOA score significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05), neurological recovery rates were similar (62.7% vs. 63.4%), cervical ROM did not significantly change when compared with the preoperative level (P &gt; 0.05) in both groups; CSA and cross-sectional area of the posterior cervical muscles decreased significantly in group B (P &lt; 0.05) but not in group A (P &gt; 0.05), and postoperative AS were significantly more severe in group B than in group A (P &lt; 0.05).Conclusion﻿Open-door laminoplasty is an effective surgical procedure for CSM. The application of modified centerpiece mini-plate fixation effectively reconstructs the posterior extensor attachment points, which reduces posterior cervical muscle atrophy, maintains cervical curvature, and reduces the occurrence of axial symptoms.</jats:p>",crossref

This study evaluated whether probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, bacterial strains previously used as biocontrol agents in plant science, as well as a selected plant pathogen could compete with foodborne human pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), for growth in microbiological media and attachment to vegetable seeds; and to determine whether the metabolites in cell-free supernatants of competitive bacterial spent cultures could inhibit the growth of the two pathogens. The results suggest that the co-presence of competitive bacteria, especially L. rhamnosus GG, significantly (p &lt; 0.05) inhibited the growth of Salmonella and EHEC. Cell-free supernatants of L. rhamnosus GG cultures significantly reduced the pathogen populations in microbiological media. Although not as effective as L. rhamnosus GG in inhibiting the growth of Salmonella and EHEC, the biocontrol agents were more effective in competing for attachment to vegetable seeds. The study observed the inhibition of human bacterial pathogens by competitive bacteria or their metabolites and the competitive attachment to sprout seeds among all bacteria involved. The results will help strategize interventions to produce vegetable seeds and seed sprouts free of foodborne pathogens.</jats:p>",crossref

The process consists of two different forming stages carried out sequentially in a single stroke. Firstly, the free tube end is flared by compression with a contoured die, then is squeezed (indented) against the sheet surface to create a mechanical interlocking. The new process is carried out at an ambient temperature and, in contrast to existing joining by forming operations based on tube expansion, it avoids seal welds, tube protrusions above the sheet surfaces, and machining of grooves on the sheet holes to obtain the form-fit joints. The paper starts by analyzing the process deformation mechanics and its main operating variables and finishes by presenting examples that demonstrate its effectiveness for attaching sheets to tube ends made from polyvinylchloride and aluminum. Experimental and numerical simulation work provides support to the presentation.</jats:p>",crossref

Survey data from an Alpine winter sport destination reveal that place brand credibility is a key antecedent of consumers’ attachment. Moreover, consistent with brand signalling theory, credible place brands exert a particularly strong direct effect on consumers’ WOM. A positive effect on their intention to return, however, will result only if they feel attached with the place brand beforehand.

A major problem for designing and operating long robotic arms is that even small end effector reaction forces and arm gravity can result in large loads on proximal arm joints because of long moment arms. To solve that problem, previous researches focus on specifically designed long arms with certain compensation mechanisms. However, those specialized arm designs are difficult to be applied to existing long robotic arms and to be customized for different missions. To overcome those two drawbacks, we recently proposed a watch-like thrust-generating modular device, called flying watch, with the following two major advantages. Firstly, flying watch can be attached to different kinds of existing long robotic arms and generate thrusts to enhance arm strength. And we have proposed a thrust planning method for flying watch in our previous work. Secondly, since different flying watch attachment allocations can enhance the same robotic arm in different ways, flying watch attachment allocations can be customized to meet the needs of a specific mission. However, up to now, customizing flying watch attachment allocations to different missions is still based on human experience and there is no clear performance metric and automated design method for flying watch attachment allocation. To facilitate mission-dependent long arm enhancement, in this paper, we first propose a novel performance metric, called thrust drivability, which measures the ability of a flying watch attachment allocation to counteract unexpected end effector reaction forces. Then based on thrust drivability, we propose an automated design method, called Allocation Optimization based on Weighted Situations (AOWS), for generating mission-dependent flying watch attachment allocations counteracting both unexpected and known external forces. Simulations show that AOWS based allocation designs can counteract both known and unexpected external forces much better than human-experience-based allocation designs.</jats:p>",crossref
