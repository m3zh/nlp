Comparative Analysis of Convolutional Neural Networks Applied in the Detection of Pneumonia Through X-Ray Images of Children,,,,10.21528/lnlm-vol18-no2-art1,"{'ORCID': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1436-6391', 'authenticated-orcid': False, 'given': 'Luan Oliveira', 'family': 'Silva', 'sequence': 'first', 'affiliation': []}","<jats:p>Pneumonia is one of the most common medical problems in clinical practice and is the leading fatal infectious disease worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, pneumonia kills about 2 million children under the age of 5 and is constantly estimated to be the leading cause of infant mortality, killing more children than AIDS, malaria, and measles combined. A key element in the diagnosis is radiographic data, as chest x-rays are routinely obtained as a standard of care and can aid to differentiate the types of pneumonia. However, a rapid radiological interpretation of images is not always available, particularly in places with few resources, where childhood pneumonia has the highest incidence and mortality rates. As an alternative, the application of deep learning techniques for the classification of medical images has grown considerably in recent years. This study presents five implementations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs): ResNet50, VGG-16, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNeXt50. To support the diagnosis of the disease, these CNNs were applied to solve the classification problem of medical radiographs from people with pneumonia. InceptionResNetV2 obtained the best recall and precision results for the Normal and Pneumonia classes, 93.95% and 97.52% respectively. ResNeXt50 achieved the best precision and f1-score results for the Normal class (94.62% and 94.25% respectively) and the recall and f1-score results for the Pneumonia class (97.80% and 97.65%, respectively).</jats:p>",crossref,1

[Children with high potential and difficulties: Contributions of clinical research].,2018-10-16,,L'Encephale,S0013-7006(18)30164-7,,"We have been sensitized to children with high intellectual potential (HIP) having difficulties given the number of children consulting in our outpatient medico-psychological centres for scholastic problems (possibly leading to school failure), anxiety disorders or behavioral disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and in which a high intellectual potential was discovered during psychological assessments. It is the contrast, and more precisely the paradox, between the high intellectual potential of these children and their scholastic difficulties (including school failure), and the psychic suffering expressed by some of them, which led us to question, challenge and propose therapeutic and educational care adapted to these children. It is in this context that we created in December 2005 the CNAHP (National Center for Assistance to High Potential children and adolescents) which is a public centre integrated into the hospital-university department of child and adolescent psychiatry at Rennes. It is noteworthy that not all children with HIP have difficulties, and children with school failure or behavioral problems are not always children with HIP. However, it is necessary not to minimize the problem raised by children with HIP with difficulties by ignoring its frequency or by considering that these children are ""intelligent"" enough to manage by themselves and do not need to be helped, whereas some of them can show school failure and even be de-scholarized. Indeed, based on the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO) of an intellectual Quotient (IQ) above 130 (level corresponding to a statistical threshold), the frequency of children with HIP represents 2.3% of the population of schoolchildren aged 6 to 16. The frequency is therefore not so rare. However, it remains to be determined by French epidemiological studies what is the actual frequency of children with difficulties within a population of children with HIP. The analysis of the CNAHP research data from a clinical population (children with HIP consulting for difficulties) highlights that children with HIP can show major school problems (including school failure, defined here as having or foreseeing repetition of a grade), which corresponds to 7.5% of 611 children with HIP consulting at the CNAHP) and socioemotional problems (emotional regulation disorders) in relation to their high intellectual potential. In particular, anxiety disorders were the most frequent psychiatric disorders observed in this population (40.5%) and were significantly associated with high verbal potential. This significant association requires further studies to avoid establishing a simplistic unidirectional and reductive linear cause-effect relationships. Indeed, a high verbal potential can elicit and/or reinforce anxiety-producing representations, but anxiety disorders may also lead to a defensive over investment of verbal language. The results are discussed in this article and suggest that scholastic and/or psychological difficulties encountered by some children with HIP can be related to their high intellectual potential. It is necessary to develop therapeutic and educational care adapted to these children from a better understanding, based on research results, of their possible difficulties but also cognitive abilities. Even when children with HIP have scholastic and/or psychological difficulties, some of their cognitive skills can be preserved contrary to appearances, with for example, as seen in the CNAHP results, excellent attentional capacities shown by cognitive tests contrasting with behavioral attention deficit reported by parents. These skills are important to identify as they are resources which support the therapeutic and educational project. It is probably through an articulation among professionals from national education, health and research, in alliance with the family (parents, child, and siblings), that advances will be made. In the same way that professionals have been interested in children with intellectual disabilities, it is important to be concerned by children with HIP and difficulties located at the other end of the continuum. It is a question of ethics which concerns both caregivers and teachers. It is also a societal issue that concerns all of us given that the expression of high intellectual and creative potential in children may be essential to the societal development of innovative strategies and each nation's future. Finally, the discussion can be extended to all children, independent of their potential. What we learn from children with HIP and difficulties can be applied to each child: it is important at family, school and societal levels to facilitate the expression of the potential of children, to value their skills, and to help them to remove possible inhibitions of their potential based on individualized projects. The acceptance of singularity and differences in children can contribute to tolerance and the development of creativity, in the interest of the subject and of society.",pubmed,2

"[Self-esteem, self-centeredness and social-emotional adjustment of gifted children and adolescents].",2009-02-07,,L'Encephale,10.1016/j.encep.2008.10.006,,"There is an ongoing debate of how giftedness affects social-emotional adjustment. Self-esteem may be an indicator of social-emotional adjustment but insufficient in its explanatory capacity, especially high self-esteem which tends to produce opposite responses in regards to adjustment. A distinction between defensive and genuine high self-esteem could account for these results. In order to understand how self-esteem operates on social-emotional adjustment, it should be associated with other measurements relating to self-concern. In the Rorschach comprehensive system (CS), egocentricity index measures self-centeredness, which can be defined as the balance between self-concern and concern for others. High self-concern is associated with a neglect of the others. Operationalized here, as the interaction of high self-esteem and excessive self-concern, defensive high self-esteem should predict maladaptive outcomes.",pubmed,2
Sensory sensitivities of gifted children.,,,The American journal of occupational therapy : official publication of the American Occupational Therapy Association,,,Gifted children often display sensitivities to their environment that vary from those of the general population. Data were gathered on 6- to 11-year-old gifted children attending a public elementary school gifted program. Parents completed Dunn's (1999) Sensory Profile questionnaire regarding their child. Two primary analyses were conducted: (1) a comparison of the gifted children's sensory sensitivity with Sensory Profile norms and (2) an examination of the internal consistency of the Sensory Profile for the gifted sample. Gifted children were more sensitive to their environment and reacted with heightened emotional and behavioral responses than did children of average intelligence. Internal consistencies for the 14 Sensory Profile sections and the Sensory Profile factors for the gifted sample were found to be equal to the reported norms of the Sensory Profile. These findings further support that gifted children may have important sensory modulation differences and add to our understanding of gifted children.,pubmed,9
An evaluation of a behavioural parenting intervention for parents of gifted children.,2009-02-25,,Behaviour research and therapy,10.1016/j.brat.2009.02.008,,"Parents of gifted children identify a need for tailored parenting support, and gifted children have unique requirements and vulnerabilities. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a tailored behavioural parenting intervention, for enhancing the parenting skills of parents of gifted children and to assess the effect of these changes on the behavioural and emotional adjustment of their gifted child. A randomised controlled trial of tailored Group Triple P - Positive Parenting Program was conducted with 75 parents of children identified as gifted. Results indicated significant intervention effects for the number and frequency of parent reported child behaviour problems, as well as hyperactivity in the intervention group, relative to a waitlist control. Parents also reported significant improvements in their own parenting style, including less permissiveness, harshness, and verbosity when disciplining their child. No intervention effects were evident for teacher reports, except for a trend in relation to hyperactivity. This study demonstrated that a tailored behavioural parenting intervention is effective and acceptable for parents of gifted children, and thus has clinical implications for the delivery of parenting interventions for this population.",pubmed,9

It is especially important to rule out the differential diagnosis of ADHD because of the differences in treatment.

Development and validation of a music performance anxiety inventory for gifted adolescent musicians.,,,Journal of anxiety disorders,,,"Music performance anxiety (MPA) is a distressing experience for musicians of all ages, yet the empirical investigation of MPA in adolescents has received little attention to date. No measures specifically targeting MPA in adolescents have been empirically validated. This article presents findings of an initial study into the psychometric properties and validation of the Music Performance Anxiety Inventory for Adolescents (MPAI-A), a new self-report measure of MPA for this group. Data from 381 elite young musicians aged 12-19 years was used to investigate the factor structure, internal reliability, construct and divergent validity of the MPAI-A. Cronbach's alpha for the full measure was .91. Factor analysis identified three factors, which together accounted for 53% of the variance. Construct validity was demonstrated by significant positive relationships with social phobia (measured using the Social Phobia Anxiety Inventory [Beidel, D. C., Turner, S. M., & Morris, T. L. (1995). A new inventory to assess childhood social anxiety and phobia: The Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children. Psychological Assessment, 7(1), 73-79; Beidel, D. C., Turner, S. M., & Morris, T. L. (1998). Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C). North Tonawanda, NY: Multi-Health Systems Inc.]) and trait anxiety (measured using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory [Spielberger, C. D. (1983). State-Trait Anxiety Inventory STAI (Form Y). Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press, Inc.]). The MPAI-A demonstrated convergent validity by a moderate to strong positive correlation with an adult measure of MPA. Discriminant validity was established by a weaker positive relationship with depression, and no relationship with externalizing behavior problems. It is hoped that the MPAI-A, as the first empirically validated measure of adolescent musicians' performance anxiety, will enhance and promote phenomenological and treatment research in this area.",pubmed,2

Aggression and sexual offense in Asperger's syndrome.,,,The Israel journal of psychiatry and related sciences,,,"Asperger's Syndrome is one of the diagnostic subcategories of pervasive developmental disorders. It is characterized by a defect in reciprocal social interaction, lack of empathy for others and poor non-verbal communication. Antisocial acts, including aggression and sexual offense, are not considered to be common in this disorder. We describe an adolescent with Asperger's Syndrome whose main problems are his violence and sexual offenses. We assume that these symptoms are secondary to his diagnosis of Asperger's as a manifestation of his difficulties with the ""theory of mind"" of others. This atypical case report is in contrast with the low prevalence of aggression and sexual offense in Asperger's, as reported in the literature. We discuss the reasons for this low prevalence. Our conclusions are based on one case history and a literature review. We call for further research in this field.",pubmed,2
Personality assessment with children of superior intelligence: divergence versus psychopathology.,,,Journal of personality assessment,,,"The perceptual and cognitive functioning of children with intelligence quotients greater than 135 was examined with the Rorschach Inkblot Test. A criterion measure, the Child Behavior Checklist, was also administered so as to determine whether deviations for Rorschach variables from age-appropriate norms indicated the presence of psychopathology or were evidence of nonentrenched, novel, or creative styles of encoding and processing information. Rorschach variables indicative of intellectual sophistication, nonentrenched thinking or inaccurate reality perception, and cognitive slippage were reliably elevated for this sample versus norms. Results for the Child Behavior Checklist demonstrated that the incidence of psychopathology in the intellectually superior and average samples were comparable. There was a lack of covariance between Rorschach makers of inaccurate reality perception, cognitive slippages, and schizophrenia, and the sum of behavior problems on the Child Behavior Checklist. Results for the Rorschach and Child Behavior Checklist variables were comparable for children with intelligence quotients greater than 150 versus between 136 and 140. It was concluded that the intellectually superior children did process the Rorschach stimuli in a manner that was nonentrenched and reliably different from norms, but that these differences should not routinely be considered as indications of psychopathology.",pubmed,9
"New perspectives in autism, Part II: The differential diagnosis and neurobiology of autism.",,,Current problems in pediatrics,,,"The clinical spectrum of autism spans a broad range of functions, but the core symptoms remain the same regardless of the intelligence of the child: the autistic type of social deficit that ranges from a lack of inclination to relate to extreme difficulty with the mechanics of social interactions, a global communication deficit that involves both verbal and nonverbal modes, and a severe cognitive deficit involving concept formation (abstraction) that is combined with an exceptional memory for factual information. These symptoms may vary dramatically in severity, but the basic deficits are identifiable regardless of IQ. Under-recognition of autism is a major problem at all IQs, but especially in patients with IQs above 50. No drugs have been found to significantly improve the core deficits in autism. Antipsychotics should be avoided except for short-term use. Antidepressants, anxiolytics, and anticonvulsants are important in the treatment of depression, affective modulation, situation-related stress, and seizures. Intensive social skills training is assuming a prominent role in behavior modification programs, and success with higher-functioning autistic children suggests that outcome can be improved by intensive training. The neurobiology of autism has also undergone dramatic changes. The psychogenic theories of etiology have been completely invalidated. Autism is now considered to be a neurological disorder resulting from an error in brain development. The precise location and nature of this deficit are still being actively debated and investigated. One theory emphasizes a dysfunction of the limbic system that results in an impairment in the acquisition of information. A second theory proposes a primary role for dysfunction of the cortical association network responsible for the processing of information.",pubmed,1
Current status of the neuromaturational examination as an index of learning disability.,,,The Journal of pediatrics,,,"To further define the role of the neuromaturational examination in determining the presence of learning problems, we examined 104 boys, ages 9.5 to 14.1 years, representing three populations of school children: normal (32 boys), gifted (37), and learning disabled (35). Information concerning each child's behavior and development was obtained through a parent questionnaire; cognitive ability and academic achievement were measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (revised) and Woodcock -Johnson Psychoeducational Battery, respectively. Significant relationships emerged between the number of neuromaturational signs and data group membership (LD greater than N greater than G,P less than 0.05). The number of neuromaturational signs decreased with age for normal (P less than 0.05) and gifted (P less than 0.05) children, but not for the learning-disabled group. Tasks that differentiated the normal and learning disabled were entered into a stepwise discriminant analysis, with a resulting classification accuracy of 93.1% and 100% for the normal and learning-disabled boys, respectively. Analysis of covariance indicated that differences in performance of the three groups may reflect IQ differences among the populations. Learning disabled boys were more likely to exhibit synkinesis than normal boys, but gifted boys did not differ from the learning disabled in the frequency of synkinesis. Our data indicate that, although a composite set of neuromaturational tasks can discriminate normal and learning-disabled boys with a high level of accuracy, caution is urged because the findings may be more related to overall intelligence than to a specific learning disability.",pubmed,1
